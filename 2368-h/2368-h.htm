<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>I had a vexing dream one night, not long ago: it was about a 
fortnight after Christmas.&nbsp; I dreamt I flew out of the 
window in my nightshirt.&nbsp; I went up and up.&nbsp; I was glad
that I was going up.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have been noticing 
me,&rdquo; I thought to myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;If anything, I have 
been a bit too good.&nbsp; A little less virtue and I might have 
lived longer.&nbsp; But one cannot have everything.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
The world grew smaller and smaller.&nbsp; The last I saw of 
London was the long line of electric lamps bordering the 
Embankment; later nothing remained but a faint luminosity buried 
beneath darkness.&nbsp; It was at this point of my journey that I
heard behind me the slow, throbbing sound of wings.</p>
<p>I turned my head.&nbsp; It was the Recording Angel.&nbsp; He 
had a weary look; I judged him to be tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he acknowledged, &ldquo;it is a trying 
period for me, your Christmas time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure it must be,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;the 
wonder to me is how you get through it all.&nbsp; You see at 
Christmas time,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;all we men and women 
become generous, quite suddenly.&nbsp; It is really a delightful 
sensation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to be envied,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the first Christmas number that starts me 
off,&rdquo; I told him; &ldquo;those beautiful pictures&mdash;the
sweet child looking so pretty in her furs, giving Bovril with her
own dear little hands to the shivering street arab; the good old 
red-faced squire shovelling out plum pudding to the crowd of 
grateful villagers.&nbsp; It makes me yearn to borrow a 
collecting box and go round doing good myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is not only me&mdash;I should say I,&rdquo; I 
continued; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to run away with the 
idea that I am the only good man in the world.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what I like about Christmas, it makes everybody good.&nbsp; The 
lovely sentiments we go about repeating! the noble deeds we do! 
from a little before Christmas up to, say, the end of January! 
why noting them down must be a comfort to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;noble deeds are always 
a great joy to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are to all of us,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I love to 
think of all the good deeds I myself have done.&nbsp; I have 
often thought of keeping a diary&mdash;jotting them down each 
day.&nbsp; It would be so nice for one&rsquo;s 
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He agreed there was an idea in this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That book of yours,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I suppose, 
now, it contains all the good actions that we men and women have 
been doing during the last six weeks?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a bulky
looking volume.</p>
<p>Yes, he answered, they were all recorded in the book.</p>
<h3>The Author tells of his Good Deeds.</h3>
<p>It was more for the sake of talking of his than anything else 
that I kept up with him.&nbsp; I did not really doubt his care 
and conscientiousness, but it is always pleasant to chat about 
one&rsquo;s self.&nbsp; &ldquo;My five shillings subscription to 
the <i>Daily Telegraph&rsquo;s</i> Sixpenny Fund for the 
Unemployed&mdash;got that down all right?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>Yes, he replied, it was entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, now I come to think of it,&rdquo; 
I added, &ldquo;it was ten shillings altogether.&nbsp; They spelt
my name wrong the first time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both subscriptions had been entered, he told me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I have been to four charity dinners,&rdquo; I 
reminded him; &ldquo;I forget what the particular charity was 
about.&nbsp; I know I suffered the next morning.&nbsp; Champagne 
never does agree with me.&nbsp; But, then, if you don&rsquo;t 
order it people think you can&rsquo;t afford it.&nbsp; Not that I
don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my liver, if you 
understand.&nbsp; If I take more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He interrupted me with the assurance that my attendance had 
been noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last week I sent a dozen photographs of myself, signed,
to a charity bazaar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said he remembered my doing so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me see,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I have been
to two ordinary balls.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care much about 
dancing, but a few of us generally play a little bridge; and to 
one fancy dress affair.&nbsp; I went as Sir Walter Raleigh.&nbsp;
Some men cannot afford to show their leg.&nbsp; What I say is, if
a man can, why not?&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t often that one gets the 
opportunity of really looking one&rsquo;s best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told me all three balls had been duly entered: and 
commented upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, of course, you remember my performance of Talbot 
Champneys in <i>Our Boys</i> the week before last, in aid of the 
Fund for Poor Curates,&rdquo; I went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
don&rsquo;t know whether you saw the notice in the <i>Morning 
Post</i>, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He again interrupted me to remark that what the <i>Morning 
Post</i> man said would be entered, one way or the other, to the 
critic of the <i>Morning Post</i>, and had nothing to do with 
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; I agreed; &ldquo;and 
between ourselves, I don&rsquo;t think the charity got very 
much.&nbsp; Expenses, when you come to add refreshments and one 
thing and another, mount up.&nbsp; But I fancy they rather liked 
my Talbot Champneys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied that he had been present at the performance, and 
had made his own report.</p>
<p>I also reminded him of the four balcony seats I had taken for 
the monster show at His Majesty&rsquo;s in aid of the Fund for 
the Destitute British in Johannesburg.&nbsp; Not all the 
celebrated actors and actresses announced on the posters had 
appeared, but all had sent letters full of kindly wishes; and the
others&mdash;all the celebrities one had never heard of&mdash;had
turned up to a man.&nbsp; Still, on the whole, the show was well 
worth the money.&nbsp; There was nothing to grumble at.</p>
<p>There were other noble deeds of mine.&nbsp; I could not 
remember them at the time in their entirety.&nbsp; I seemed to 
have done a good many.&nbsp; But I did remember the rummage sale 
to which I sent all my old clothes, including a coat that had got
mixed up with them by accident, and that I believe I could have 
worn again.</p>
<p>And also the raffle I had joined for a motor-car.</p>
<p>The Angel said I really need not be alarmed, that everything 
had been noted, together with other matters I, may be, had 
forgotten.</p>
<h3>The Angel appears to have made a slight Mistake.</h3>
<p>I felt a certain curiosity.&nbsp; We had been getting on very 
well together&mdash;so it had seemed to me.&nbsp; I asked him if 
he would mind my seeing the book.&nbsp; He said there could be no
objection.&nbsp; He opened it at the page devoted to myself, and 
I flew a little higher, and looked down over his shoulder.&nbsp; 
I can hardly believe it, even now&mdash;that I could have dreamt 
anything so foolish:</p>
<p>He had got it all down wrong!</p>
<p>Instead of to the credit side of my account he had put the 
whole bag of tricks to my debit.&nbsp; He had mixed them up with 
my sins&mdash;with my acts of hypocrisy, vanity, 
self-indulgence.&nbsp; Under the head of Charity he had but one 
item to my credit for the past six months: my giving up my seat 
inside a tramcar, late one wet night, to a dismal-looking old 
woman, who had not had even the politeness to say &ldquo;thank 
you,&rdquo; she seemed just half asleep.&nbsp; According to this 
idiot, all the time and money I had spent responding to these 
charitable appeals had been wasted.</p>
<p>I was not angry with him, at first.&nbsp; I was willing to 
regard what he had done as merely a clerical error.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have got the items down all right,&rdquo; I said (I
spoke quite friendly), &ldquo;but you have made a slight 
mistake&mdash;we all do now and again; you have put them down on 
the wrong side of the book.&nbsp; I only hope this sort of thing 
doesn&rsquo;t occur often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What irritated me as much as anything was the grave, 
passionless face the Angel turned upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no mistake,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mistake!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, you 
blundering&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He closed the book with a weary sigh.</p>
<p>I felt so mad with him, I went to snatch it out of his 
hand.&nbsp; He did not do anything that I was aware of, but at 
once I began falling.&nbsp; The faint luminosity beneath me grew,
and then the lights of London seemed shooting up to meet 
me.&nbsp; I was coming down on the clock tower at 
Westminster.&nbsp; I gave myself a convulsive twist, hoping to 
escape it, and fell into the river.</p>
<p>And then I awoke.</p>
<p>But it stays with me: the weary sadness of the Angel&rsquo;s 
face.&nbsp; I cannot shake remembrance from me.&nbsp; Would I 
have done better, had I taken the money I had spent upon these 
fooleries, gone down with it among the poor myself, asking 
nothing in return.&nbsp; Is this fraction of our superfluity, 
flung without further thought or care into the collection box, 
likely to satisfy the Impracticable Idealist, who actually 
suggested&mdash;one shrugs one&rsquo;s shoulders when one thinks 
of it&mdash;that one should sell all one had and give to the 
poor?</p>
<h3>The Author is troubled concerning his Investments.</h3>
<p>Or is our charity but a salve to conscience&mdash;an 
insurance, at decidedly moderate premium, in case, after all, 
there should happen to be another world?&nbsp; Is Charity lending
to the Lord something we can so easily do without?</p>
<p>I remember a lady tidying up her house, clearing it of 
rubbish.&nbsp; She called it &ldquo;Giving to the Fresh Air 
Fund.&rdquo;&nbsp; Into the heap of lumber one of her daughters 
flung a pair of crutches that for years had been knocking about 
the house.&nbsp; The lady picked them out again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t give those away,&rdquo; she said, 
&ldquo;they might come in useful again.&nbsp; One never 
knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another lady, I remember coming downstairs one evening dressed
for a fancy ball.&nbsp; I forget the title of the charity, but I 
remember that every lady who sold more than ten tickets received 
an autograph letter of thanks from the Duchess who was the 
president.&nbsp; The tickets were twelve and sixpence each and 
included light refreshments and a very substantial supper.&nbsp; 
One presumes the odd sixpence reached the poor&mdash;or at least 
the noisier portion of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;e</i>, isn&rsquo;t 
it, my dear?&rdquo; suggested a lady friend, as the charitable 
dancer entered the drawing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is&mdash;a little,&rdquo; she admitted, 
&ldquo;but we all of us ought to do all we can for the 
Cause.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think so, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really, seeing the amount we give in charity, the wonder is 
there are any poor left.&nbsp; It is a comfort that there 
are.&nbsp; What should we do without them?&nbsp; Our fur-clad 
little girls! our jolly, red-faced squires! we should never know 
how good they were, but for the poor?&nbsp; Without the poor how 
could we be virtuous?&nbsp; We should have to go about giving to 
each other.&nbsp; And friends expect such expensive presents, 
while a shilling here and there among the poor brings to us all 
the sensations of a good Samaritan.&nbsp; Providence has been 
very thoughtful in providing us with poor.</p>
<p>Dear Lady Bountiful! does it not ever occur to you to thank 
God for the poor?&nbsp; The clean, grateful poor, who bob their 
heads and curtsey and assure you that heaven is going to repay 
you a thousandfold.&nbsp; One does hope you will not be 
disappointed.</p>
<p>An East-End curate once told me, with a twinkle in his eye, of
a smart lady who called upon him in her carriage, and insisted on
his going round with her to show her where the poor hid 
themselves.&nbsp; They went down many streets, and the lady 
distributed her parcels.&nbsp; Then they came to one of the 
worst, a very narrow street.&nbsp; The coachman gave it one 
glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, my lady,&rdquo; said the coachman, &ldquo;but 
the carriage won&rsquo;t go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid we shall have to leave it,&rdquo; she 
said.</p>
<p>So the gallant greys dashed past.</p>
<p>Where the real poor creep I fear there is no room for Lady 
Bountiful&rsquo;s fine coach.&nbsp; The ways are very 
narrow&mdash;wide enough only for little Sister Pity, stealing 
softly.</p>
<p>I put it to my friend, the curate:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if all this charity is, as you say, so useless; if 
it touches but the fringe; if it makes the evil worse, what would
you do?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>And questions a Man of Thought.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I would substitute Justice,&rdquo; he answered; 
&ldquo;there would be no need for Charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;But it is so delightful to give,&rdquo; I 
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is better to 
give than to receive.&nbsp; I was thinking of the receiver.&nbsp;
And my ideal is a long way off.&nbsp; We shall have to work 
towards it slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>Philosophy and the D&aelig;mon.</h3>
<p>Philosophy, it has been said, is the art of bearing other 
people&rsquo;s troubles.&nbsp; The truest philosopher I ever 
heard of was a woman.&nbsp; She was brought into the London 
Hospital suffering from a poisoned leg.&nbsp; The house surgeon 
made a hurried examination.&nbsp; He was a man of blunt 
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will have to come off,&rdquo; he told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, not all of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole of it, I am sorry to say,&rdquo; growled the 
house surgeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing else for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other chance for you whatever,&rdquo; explained the 
house surgeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, thank Gawd it&rsquo;s not my 
&rsquo;ead,&rdquo; observed the lady.</p>
<p>The poor have a great advantage over us better-off folk.&nbsp;
Providence provides them with many opportunities for the practice
of philosophy.&nbsp; I was present at a &ldquo;high tea&rdquo; 
given last winter by charitable folk to a party of 
char-women.&nbsp; After the tables were cleared we sought to 
amuse them.&nbsp; One young lady, who was proud of herself as a 
palmist, set out to study their &ldquo;lines.&rdquo;&nbsp; At 
sight of the first toil-worn hand she took hold of her 
sympathetic face grew sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a great trouble coming to you,&rdquo; she 
informed the ancient dame.</p>
<p>The placid-featured dame looked up and smiled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, only one, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, only one,&rdquo; asserted the kind fortune-teller,
much pleased, &ldquo;after that all goes smoothly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; murmured the old dame, quite cheerfully, 
&ldquo;we was all of us a short-lived family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our skins harden to the blows of Fate.&nbsp; I was lunching 
one Wednesday with a friend in the country.&nbsp; His son and 
heir, aged twelve, entered and took his seat at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;and how did we get
on at school to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; answered the youngster, settling 
himself down to his dinner with evident appetite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody caned?&rdquo; demanded his father, with&mdash;as
I noticed&mdash;a sly twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied young hopeful, after reflection; 
&ldquo;no, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; adding as an 
afterthought, as he tucked into beef and potatoes, 
&ldquo;&rsquo;cepting, o&rsquo; course, me.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>When the D&aelig;mon will not work.</h3>
<p>It is a simple science, philosophy.&nbsp; The idea is that it 
never matters what happens to you provided you don&rsquo;t mind 
it.&nbsp; The weak point in the argument is that nine times out 
of ten you can&rsquo;t help minding it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No misfortune can harm me,&rdquo; says Marcus Aurelius,
&ldquo;without the consent of the d&aelig;mon within 
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trouble is our d&aelig;mon cannot always be relied 
upon.&nbsp; So often he does not seem up to his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a naughty boy, and I&rsquo;m going to
whip you,&rdquo; said nurse to a four-year-old criminal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tant,&rdquo; retorted the young ruffian, gripping 
with both hands the chair that he was occupying, 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;se sittin&rsquo; on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His d&aelig;mon was, no doubt, resolved that misfortune, as 
personified by nurse, should not hurt him.&nbsp; The misfortune, 
alas! proved stronger than the d&aelig;mon, and misfortune, he 
found did hurt him.</p>
<p>The toothache cannot hurt us so long as the d&aelig;mon within
us (that is to say, our will power) holds on to the chair and 
says it can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But, sooner or later, the d&aelig;mon 
lets go, and then we howl.&nbsp; One sees the idea: in theory it 
is excellent.&nbsp; One makes believe.&nbsp; Your bank has 
suddenly stopped payment.&nbsp; You say to yourself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This does not really matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your butcher and your baker say it does, and insist on making 
a row in the passage.</p>
<p>You fill yourself up with gooseberry wine.&nbsp; You tell 
yourself it is seasoned champagne.&nbsp; Your liver next morning 
says it is not.</p>
<p>The d&aelig;mon within us means well, but forgets it is not 
the only thing there.&nbsp; A man I knew was an enthusiast on 
vegetarianism.&nbsp; He argued that if the poor would adopt a 
vegetarian diet the problem of existence would be simpler for 
them, and maybe he was right.&nbsp; So one day he assembled some 
twenty poor lads for the purpose of introducing to them a 
vegetarian lunch.&nbsp; He begged them to believe that lentil 
beans were steaks, that cauliflowers were chops.&nbsp; As a third
course he placed before them a mixture of carrots and savoury 
herbs, and urged them to imagine they were eating saveloys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you all like saveloys,&rdquo; he said, addressing 
them, &ldquo;and the palate is but the creature of the 
imagination.&nbsp; Say to yourselves, &lsquo;I am eating 
saveloys,&rsquo; and for all practical purposes these things will
be saveloys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the lads professed to have done it, but one 
disappointed-looking youth confessed to failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you be sure it was not a saveloy?&rdquo; 
the host persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; explained the boy, &ldquo;I 
haven&rsquo;t got the stomach-ache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared that saveloys, although a dish of which he was 
fond, invariably and immediately disagreed with him.&nbsp; If 
only we were all d&aelig;mon and nothing else philosophy would be
easier.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is more of us.</p>
<p>Another argument much approved by philosophy is that nothing 
matters, because a hundred years hence, say, at the outside, we 
shall be dead.&nbsp; What we really want is a philosophy that 
will enable us to get along while we are still alive.&nbsp; I am 
not worrying about my centenary; I am worrying about next 
quarter-day.&nbsp; I feel that if other people would only go 
away, and leave me&mdash;income-tax collectors, critics, men who 
come round about the gas, all those sort of people&mdash;I could 
be a philosopher myself.&nbsp; I am willing enough to make 
believe that nothing matters, but they are not.&nbsp; They say it
is going to be cut off, and talk about judgment summonses.&nbsp; 
I tell them it won&rsquo;t trouble any of us a hundred years 
hence.&nbsp; They answer they are not talking of a hundred years 
hence, but of this thing that was due last April 
twelvemonth.&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t listen to my 
d&aelig;mon.&nbsp; He does not interest them.&nbsp; Nor, to be 
candid, does it comfort myself very much, this philosophical 
reflection that a hundred years later on I&rsquo;ll be sure to be
dead&mdash;that is, with ordinary luck.&nbsp; What bucks me up 
much more is the hope that they will be dead.&nbsp; Besides, in a
hundred years things may have improved.&nbsp; I may not want to 
be dead.&nbsp; If I were sure of being dead next morning, before 
their threat of cutting off that water or that gas could by any 
possibility be carried out, before that judgment summons they are
bragging about could be made returnable, I might&mdash;I 
don&rsquo;t say I should&mdash;be amused, thinking how I was 
going to dish them.&nbsp; The wife of a very wicked man visited 
him one evening in prison, and found him enjoying a supper of 
toasted cheese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How foolish of you, Edward,&rdquo; argued the fond 
lady, &ldquo;to be eating toasted cheese for supper.&nbsp; You 
know it always affects your liver.&nbsp; All day long to-morrow 
you will be complaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interrupted Edward; 
&ldquo;not so foolish as you think me.&nbsp; They are going to 
hang me to-morrow&mdash;early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a passage in Marcus Aurelius that used to puzzle me 
until I hit upon the solution.&nbsp; A foot-note says the meaning
is obscure.&nbsp; Myself, I had gathered this before I read the 
foot-note.&nbsp; What it is all about I defy any human being to 
explain.&nbsp; It might mean anything; it might mean 
nothing.&nbsp; The majority of students incline to the latter 
theory, though a minority maintain there is a meaning, if only it
could be discovered.&nbsp; My own conviction is that once in his 
life Marcus Aurelius had a real good time.&nbsp; He came home 
feeling pleased with himself without knowing quite why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will write it down,&rdquo; he said to himself, 
&ldquo;now, while it is fresh in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to him the most wonderful thing that anybody had 
ever said.&nbsp; Maybe he shed a tear or two, thinking of all the
good he was doing, and later on went suddenly to sleep.&nbsp; In 
the morning he had forgotten all about it, and by accident it got
mixed up with the rest of the book.&nbsp; That is the only 
explanation that seems to me possible, and it comforts me.</p>
<p>We are none of us philosophers all the time.</p>
<p>Philosophy is the science of suffering the inevitable, which 
most of us contrive to accomplish without the aid of 
philosophy.&nbsp; Marcus Aurelius was an Emperor of Rome, and 
Diogenes was a bachelor living rent free.&nbsp; I want the 
philosophy of the bank clerk married on thirty shillings a week, 
of the farm labourer bringing up a family of eight on a 
precarious wage of twelve shillings.&nbsp; The troubles of Marcus
Aurelius were chiefly those of other people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taxes will have to go up, I am afraid,&rdquo; no doubt 
he often sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, after all, what are 
taxes?&nbsp; A thing in conformity with the nature of man&mdash;a
little thing that Zeus approves of, one feels sure.&nbsp; The 
d&aelig;mon within me says taxes don&rsquo;t really 
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe the paterfamilias of the period, who did the paying, 
worried about new sandals for the children, his wife insisting 
she hadn&rsquo;t a frock fit to be seen in at the amphitheatre; 
that, if there was one thing in the world she fancied, it was 
seeing a Christian eaten by a lion, but now she supposed the 
children would have to go without her, found that philosophy came
to his aid less readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother these barbarians,&rdquo; Marcus Aurelius may 
have been tempted, in an unphilosophical moment, to exclaim; 
&ldquo;I do wish they would not burn these poor people&rsquo;s 
houses over their heads, toss the babies about on spears, and 
carry off the older children into slavery.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t 
they behave themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But philosophy in Marcus Aurelius would eventually triumph 
over passing fretfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how foolish of me to be angry with them,&rdquo; he 
would argue with himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;One is not vexed with the 
fig-tree for yielding figs, with the cucumber for being 
bitter!&nbsp; One must expect barbarians to behave 
barbariously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius would proceed to slaughter the barbarians, and
then forgive them.&nbsp; We can most of us forgive our brother 
his transgressions, having once got even with him.&nbsp; In a 
tiny Swiss village, behind the angle of the school-house wall, I 
came across a maiden crying bitterly, her head resting on her 
arm.&nbsp; I asked her what had happened.&nbsp; Between her sobs 
she explained that a school companion, a little lad about her own
age, having snatched her hat from her head, was at that moment 
playing football with it the other side of the wall.&nbsp; I 
attempted to console her with philosophy.&nbsp; I pointed out to 
her that boys would be boys&mdash;that to expect from them at 
that age reverence for feminine headgear was to seek what was not
conformable with the nature of boy.&nbsp; But she appeared to 
have no philosophy in her.&nbsp; She said he was a horrid boy, 
and that she hated him.&nbsp; It transpired it was a hat she 
rather fancied herself in.&nbsp; He peeped round the corner while
we were talking, the hat in his hand.&nbsp; He held it out to 
her, but she took no notice of him.&nbsp; I gathered the incident
was closed, and went my way, but turned a few steps further on, 
curious to witness the end.&nbsp; Step by step he approached 
nearer, looking a little ashamed of himself; but still she wept, 
her face hidden in her arm.</p>
<p>He was not expecting it: to all seeming she stood there the 
personification of the grief that is not to be comforted, 
oblivious to all surroundings.&nbsp; Incautiously he took another
step.&nbsp; In an instant she had &ldquo;landed&rdquo; him over 
the head with a long narrow wooden box containing, one supposes, 
pencils and pens.&nbsp; He must have been a hard-headed 
youngster, the sound of the compact echoed through the 
valley.&nbsp; I met her again on my way back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hat much damaged?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she answered, smiling; &ldquo;besides, 
it was only an old hat.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got a better one for 
Sundays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I often feel philosophical myself; generally over a good cigar
after a satisfactory dinner.&nbsp; At such times I open my Marcus
Aurelius, my pocket Epicurus, my translation of Plato&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Republic.&rdquo;&nbsp; At such times I agree with 
them.&nbsp; Man troubles himself too much about the 
unessential.&nbsp; Let us cultivate serenity.&nbsp; Nothing can 
happen to us that we have not been constituted by Nature to 
sustain.&nbsp; That foolish farm labourer, on his precarious wage
of twelve shillings a week: let him dwell rather on the mercies 
he enjoys.&nbsp; Is he not spared all anxiety concerning safe 
investment of capital yielding four per cent.?&nbsp; Is not the 
sunrise and the sunset for him also?&nbsp; Many of us never see 
the sunrise.&nbsp; So many of our so-termed poorer brethen are 
privileged rarely to miss that early morning festival.&nbsp; Let 
the d&aelig;mon within them rejoice.&nbsp; Why should he fret 
when the children cry for bread?&nbsp; Is it not in the nature of
things that the children of the poor should cry for bread?&nbsp; 
The gods in their wisdom have arranged it thus.&nbsp; Let the 
d&aelig;mon within him reflect upon the advantage to the 
community of cheap labour.&nbsp; Let the farm labourer 
contemplate the universal good.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>Literature and the Middle Classes.</h3>
<p>I am sorry to be compelled to cast a slur upon the Literary 
profession, but observation shows me that it still contains 
within its ranks writers born and bred in, and moving 
amidst&mdash;if, without offence, one may put it bluntly&mdash;a 
purely middle-class environment: men and women to whom Park Lane 
will never be anything than the shortest route between Notting 
Hill and the Strand; to whom Debrett&rsquo;s 
Peerage&mdash;gilt-edged and bound in red, a tasteful-looking 
volume&mdash;ever has been and ever will remain a drawing-room 
ornament and not a social necessity.&nbsp; Now what is to become 
of these writers&mdash;of us, if for the moment I may be allowed 
to speak as representative of this rapidly-diminishing yet 
nevertheless still numerous section of the world of Art and 
Letters?&nbsp; Formerly, provided we were masters of style, 
possessed imagination and insight, understood human nature, had 
sympathy with and knowledge of life, and could express ourselves 
with humour and distinction, our pathway was, comparatively 
speaking, free from obstacle.&nbsp; We drew from the middle-class
life around us, passed it through our own middle-class 
individuality, and presented it to a public composed of 
middle-class readers.</p>
<p>But the middle-class public, for purposes of Art, has 
practically disappeared.&nbsp; The social strata from which 
George Eliot and Dickens drew their characters no longer 
interests the great B. P. Hetty Sorrell, Little Em&rsquo;ly, 
would be pronounced &ldquo;provincial;&rdquo; a Deronda or a 
Wilfer Family ignored as &ldquo;suburban.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I confess that personally the terms &ldquo;provincial&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;suburban,&rdquo; as epithets of reproach, have always 
puzzled me.&nbsp; I never met anyone more severe on what she 
termed the &ldquo;suburban note&rdquo; in literature than a thin 
lady who lived in a semi-detached villa in a by-street of 
Hammersmith.&nbsp; Is Art merely a question of geography, and if 
so what is the exact limit?&nbsp; Is it the four-mile cab radius 
from Charing Cross?&nbsp; Is the cheesemonger of Tottenham Court 
Road of necessity a man of taste, and the Oxford professor of 
necessity a Philistine?&nbsp; I want to understand this 
thing.&nbsp; I once hazarded the direct question to a critical 
friend:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say a book is suburban,&rdquo; I put it to him, 
&ldquo;and there is an end to the matter.&nbsp; But what do you 
mean by suburban?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I mean it is the sort 
of book likely to appeal to the class that inhabits the 
suburbs.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lived himself in Chancery Lane.</p>
<h3>May a man of intelligence live, say, in Surbiton?</h3>
<p>&ldquo;But there is Jones, the editor of <i>The Evening 
Gentleman</i>,&rdquo; I argued; &ldquo;he lives at 
Surbiton.&nbsp; It is just twelve miles from Waterloo.&nbsp; He 
comes up every morning by the eight-fifteen and returns again by 
the five-ten.&nbsp; Would you say that a book is bound to be bad 
because it appeals to Jones?&nbsp; Then again, take Tomlinson: he
lives, as you are well aware, at Forest Gate which is Epping way,
and entertains you on Kakemonos whenever you call upon him.&nbsp;
You know what I mean, of course.&nbsp; I think 
&lsquo;Kakemono&rsquo; is right.&nbsp; They are long things; they
look like coloured hieroglyphics printed on brown paper.&nbsp; He
gets behind them and holds them up above his head on the end of a
stick so that you can see the whole of them at once; and he tells
you the name of the Japanese artist who painted them in the year 
1500 B.C., and what it is all about.&nbsp; He shows them to you 
by the hour and forgets to give you dinner.&nbsp; There 
isn&rsquo;t an easy chair in the house.&nbsp; To put it vulgarly,
what is wrong with Tomlinson from a high art point of view?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man I know who lives in Birmingham: you
must have heard of him.&nbsp; He is the great collector of 
Eighteenth Century caricatures, the Rowlandson and Gilray school 
of things.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t call them artistic myself; they 
make me ill to look at them; but people who understand Art rave 
about them.&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t a man be artistic who has got a
cottage in the country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand me,&rdquo; retorted my 
critical friend, a little irritably, as I thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit it,&rdquo; I returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is what 
I am trying to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course artistic people live in the suburbs,&rdquo; 
he admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;But they are not of the 
suburbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though they may dwell in Wimbledon or Hornsey,&rdquo; I
suggested, &ldquo;they sing with the Scotch bard: &lsquo;My heart
is in the South-West postal district.&nbsp; My heart is not 
here.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can put it that way if you like,&rdquo; he 
growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, if you have no objection,&rdquo; I 
agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It makes life easier for those of us with 
limited incomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The modern novel takes care, however, to avoid all doubt upon 
the subject.&nbsp; Its personages, one and all, reside within the
half-mile square lying between Bond Street and the Park&mdash;a 
neighbourhood that would appear to be somewhat densely 
populated.&nbsp; True, a year or two ago there appeared a fairly 
successful novel the heroine of which resided in Onslow 
Gardens.&nbsp; An eminent critic observed of it that: &ldquo;It 
fell short only by a little way of being a serious contribution 
to English literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; Consultation with the keeper 
of the cabman&rsquo;s shelter at Hyde Park Corner suggested to me
that the &ldquo;little way&rdquo; the critic had in mind measures
exactly eleven hundred yards.&nbsp; When the nobility and gentry 
of the modern novel do leave London they do not go into the 
provinces: to do that would be vulgar.&nbsp; They make straight 
for &ldquo;Barchester Towers,&rdquo; or what the Duke calls 
&ldquo;his little place up north&rdquo;&mdash;localities, one 
presumes, suspended somewhere in mid-air.</p>
<p>In every social circle exist great souls with yearnings 
towards higher things.&nbsp; Even among the labouring classes one
meets with naturally refined natures, gentlemanly persons to whom
the loom and the plough will always appear low, whose natural 
desire is towards the dignities and graces of the servants&rsquo;
hall.&nbsp; So in Grub Street we can always reckon upon the 
superior writer whose temperament will prompt him to make 
respectful study of his betters.&nbsp; A reasonable supply of 
high-class novels might always have been depended upon; the 
trouble is that the public now demands that all stories must be 
of the upper ten thousand.&nbsp; Auld Robin Grey must be Sir 
Robert Grey, South African millionaire; and Jamie, the youngest 
son of the old Earl, otherwise a cultured public can take no 
interest in the ballad.&nbsp; A modern nursery rhymester to 
succeed would have to write of Little Lord Jack and Lady Jill 
ascending one of the many beautiful eminences belonging to the 
ancestral estates of their parents, bearing between them, on a 
silver rod, an exquisitely painted S&egrave;vres vase filled with
ottar of roses.</p>
<p>I take up my fourpenny-halfpenny magazine.&nbsp; The heroine 
is a youthful Duchess; her husband gambles with thousand-pound 
notes, with the result that they are reduced to living on the 
first floor of the Carlton Hotel.&nbsp; The villain is a Russian 
Prince.&nbsp; The Baronet of a simpler age has been unable, poor 
fellow, to keep pace with the times.&nbsp; What self-respecting 
heroine would abandon her husband and children for sin and a 
paltry five thousand a year?&nbsp; To the heroine of the 
past&mdash;to the clergyman&rsquo;s daughter or the lady 
artist&mdash;he was dangerous.&nbsp; The modern heroine 
misbehaves herself with nothing below Cabinet rank.</p>
<p>I turn to something less pretentious, a weekly periodical that
my wife tells me is the best authority she has come across on 
blouses.&nbsp; I find in it what once upon a time would have been
called a farce.&nbsp; It is now a &ldquo;drawing-room 
comedietta.&nbsp; All rights reserved.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
<i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> consist of the Earl of Danbury, the
Marquis of Rottenborough (with a past), and an American 
heiress&mdash;a character that nowadays takes with lovers of the 
simple the place formerly occupied by &ldquo;Rose, the 
miller&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder, is it such teaching as that of Carlyle and
Tennyson that is responsible for this present tendency of 
literature?&nbsp; Carlyle impressed upon us that the only history
worth consideration was the life of great men and women, and 
Tennyson that we &ldquo;needs must love the highest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So literature, striving ever upward, ignores plain Romola for the
Lady Ponsonby de Tompkins; the provincialisms of a Charlotte 
Bront&euml; for what a certain critic, born before his time, 
would have called the &ldquo;doin&rsquo;s of the hupper 
succles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The British Drama has advanced by even greater bounds.&nbsp; 
It takes place now exclusively within castle walls, 
and&mdash;what Messrs. Lumley &amp; Co.&rsquo;s circular would 
describe as&mdash;&ldquo;desirable town mansions, suitable for 
gentlemen of means.&rdquo;&nbsp; A living dramatist, who should 
know, tells us that drama does not occur in the back 
parlour.&nbsp; Dramatists have, it has been argued, occasionally 
found it there, but such may have been dramatists with eyes 
capable of seeing through clothes.</p>
<p>I once wrote a play which I read to a distinguished 
Manager.&nbsp; He said it was a most interesting play: they 
always say that.&nbsp; I waited, wondering to what other manager 
he would recommend me to take it.&nbsp; To my surprise he told me
he would like it for himself&mdash;but with alterations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole thing wants lifting up,&rdquo; was his 
opinion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your hero is a barrister: my public take no
interest in plain barristers.&nbsp; Make him the Solicitor 
General.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s got to be amusing,&rdquo; I 
argued.&nbsp; &ldquo;A Solicitor General is never 
amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Manager pondered for a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let him be 
Solicitor General for Ireland,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>I made a note of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your heroine,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is the 
daughter of a seaside lodging-house keeper.&nbsp; My public do 
not recognize seaside lodgings.&nbsp; Why not the daughter of an 
hotel proprietor?&nbsp; Even that will be risky, but we might 
venture it.&rdquo;&nbsp; An inspiration came to him.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Or better still, let the old man be the Managing Director 
of an hotel Trust: that would account for her clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I put the thing aside for a few months, and when
I was ready again the public taste had still further 
advanced.&nbsp; The doors of the British Drama were closed for 
the time being on all but members of the aristocracy, and I did 
not see my comic old man as a Marquis, which was the lowest title
that just then one dared to offer to a low comedian.</p>
<p>Now how are we middle-class novelists and dramatists to 
continue to live?&nbsp; I am aware of the obvious retort, but to 
us it absolutely is necessary.&nbsp; We know only parlours: we 
call them drawing-rooms.&nbsp; At the bottom of our middle-class 
hearts we regard them fondly: the folding-doors thrown back, they
make rather a fine apartment.&nbsp; The only drama that we know 
takes place in such rooms: the hero sitting in the 
gentleman&rsquo;s easy chair, of green repp: the heroine in the 
lady&rsquo;s ditto, without arms&mdash;the chair, I mean.&nbsp; 
The scornful glances, the bitter words of our middle-class world 
are hurled across these three-legged loo-tables, the wedding-cake
ornament under its glass case playing the part of white 
ghost.</p>
<p>In these days, when &ldquo;Imperial cement&rdquo; is at a 
premium, who would dare suggest that the emotions of a parlour 
can by any possibility be the same as those exhibited in a salon 
furnished in the style of Louis Quatorze; that the tears of 
Bayswater can possibly be compared for saltness with the 
lachrymal fluid distilled from South Audley Street glands; that 
the laughter of Clapham can be as catching as the cultured cackle
of Curzon Street?&nbsp; But we, whose best clothes are exhibited 
only in parlours, what are we to do?&nbsp; How can we lay bare 
the souls of Duchesses, explain the heart-throbs of peers of the 
realm?&nbsp; Some of my friends who, being Conservative, attend 
Primrose &ldquo;tourneys&rdquo; (or is it &ldquo;Courts of 
love&rdquo;?&nbsp; I speak as an outsider.&nbsp; Something 
medi&aelig;val, I know it is) do, it is true, occasionally 
converse with titled ladies.&nbsp; But the period for 
conversation is always limited owing to the impatience of the man
behind; and I doubt if the interview is ever of much practical 
use to them, as conveying knowledge of the workings of the 
aristocratic mind.&nbsp; Those of us who are not Primrose Knights
miss even this poor glimpse into the world above us.&nbsp; We 
know nothing, simply nothing, concerning the deeper feelings of 
the upper ten.&nbsp; Personally, I once received a letter from an
Earl, but that was in connection with a dairy company of which 
his lordship was chairman, and spoke only of his lordship&rsquo;s
views concerning milk and the advantages of the cash 
system.&nbsp; Of what I really wished to know&mdash;his 
lordship&rsquo;s passions, yearnings and general attitude to 
life&mdash;the circular said nothing.</p>
<p>Year by year I find myself more and more in a minority.&nbsp; 
One by one my literary friends enter into this charmed 
aristocratic circle; after which one hears no more from them 
regarding the middle-classes.&nbsp; At once they set to work to 
describe the mental sufferings of Grooms of the Bed-chamber, the 
hidden emotions of Ladies in their own right, the religious 
doubts of Marquises.&nbsp; I want to know how they do 
it&mdash;&ldquo;how the devil they get there.&rdquo;&nbsp; They 
refuse to tell me.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I see nothing before me but the workhouse.&nbsp; 
Year by year the public grows more impatient of literature 
dealing merely with the middle-classes.&nbsp; I know nothing 
about any other class.&nbsp; What am I to do?</p>
<p>Commonplace people&mdash;friends of mine without conscience, 
counsel me in flippant phrase to &ldquo;have a shot at 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect, old fellow, you know just as much about it as
these other Johnnies do.&rdquo;&nbsp; (I am not defending their 
conversation either as regards style or matter: I am merely 
quoting.)&nbsp; &ldquo;And even if you don&rsquo;t, what does it 
matter?&nbsp; The average reader knows less.&nbsp; How is he to 
find you out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, as I explain to them, it is the law of literature never 
to write except about what you really know.&nbsp; I want to mix 
with the aristocracy, study them, understand them; so that I may 
earn my living in the only way a literary man nowadays can earn 
his living, namely, by writing about the upper circles.</p>
<p>I want to know how to get there.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>Man and his Master.</h3>
<p>There is one thing that the Anglo-Saxon does better than the 
&ldquo;French, or Turk, or Rooshian,&rdquo; to which add the 
German or the Belgian.&nbsp; When the Anglo-Saxon appoints an 
official, he appoints a servant: when the others put a man in 
uniform, they add to their long list of masters.&nbsp; If among 
your acquaintances you can discover an American, or Englishman, 
unfamiliar with the continental official, it is worth your while 
to accompany him, the first time he goes out to post a letter, 
say.&nbsp; He advances towards the post-office a breezy, 
self-confident gentleman, borne up by pride of race.&nbsp; While 
mounting the steps he talks airily of &ldquo;just getting this 
letter off his mind, and then picking up Jobson and going on to 
Durand&rsquo;s for lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He talks as if he had the whole day before him.&nbsp; At the 
top of the steps he attempts to push open the door.&nbsp; It will
not move.&nbsp; He looks about him, and discovers that is the 
door of egress, not of ingress.&nbsp; It does not seem to him 
worth while redescending the twenty steps and climbing another 
twenty.&nbsp; So far as he is concerned he is willing to pull the
door, instead of pushing it.&nbsp; But a stern official bars his 
way, and haughtily indicates the proper entrance.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Oh, bother,&rdquo; he says, and down he trots again, and 
up the other flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not be a minute,&rdquo; he remarks over his 
shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can wait for me outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if you know your way about, you follow him in.&nbsp; There
are seats within, and you have a newspaper in your pocket: the 
time will pass more pleasantly.&nbsp; Inside he looks round, 
bewildered.&nbsp; The German post-office, generally speaking, is 
about the size of the Bank of England.&nbsp; Some twenty 
different windows confront your troubled friend, each one bearing
its own particular legend.&nbsp; Starting with number one, he 
sets to work to spell them out.&nbsp; It appears to him that the 
posting of letters is not a thing that the German post-office 
desires to encourage.&nbsp; Would he not like a dog licence 
instead? is what one window suggests to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, 
never mind that letter of yours; come and talk about 
bicycles,&rdquo; pleads another.&nbsp; At last he thinks he has 
found the right hole: the word &ldquo;Registration&rdquo; he 
distinctly recognizes.&nbsp; He taps at the glass.</p>
<p>Nobody takes any notice of him.&nbsp; The foreign official is 
a man whose life is saddened by a public always wanting 
something.&nbsp; You read it in his face wherever you go.&nbsp; 
The man who sells you tickets for the theatre!&nbsp; He is eating
sandwiches when you knock at his window.&nbsp; He turns to his 
companion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; you can see him say, 
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s another of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; If there has been
one man worrying me this morning there have been a hundred.&nbsp;
Always the same story: all of &rsquo;em want to come and see the 
play.&nbsp; You listen now; bet you anything he&rsquo;s going to 
bother me for tickets.&nbsp; Really, it gets on my nerves 
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the railway station it is just the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another man who wants to go to Antwerp!&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t seem to care for rest, these people: flying here, 
flying there, what&rsquo;s the sense of it?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is 
this absurd craze on the part of the public for letter-writing 
that is spoiling the temper of the continental post-office 
official.&nbsp; He does his best to discourage it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at them,&rdquo; he says to his assistant&mdash;the
thoughtful German Government is careful to provide every official
with another official for company, lest by sheer force of 
<i>ennui</i> he might be reduced to taking interest in his 
work&mdash;&ldquo;twenty of &rsquo;em, all in a row!&nbsp; Some 
of &rsquo;em been there for the last quarter of an 
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em wait another quarter of an hour,&rdquo; 
advises the assistant; &ldquo;perhaps they&rsquo;ll go 
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he answers, &ldquo;do you think 
I haven&rsquo;t tried that?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s simply no getting
rid of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s always the same cry: 
&lsquo;Stamps! stamps! stamps!&rsquo;&nbsp; &rsquo;Pon my word, I
think they live on stamps, some of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well let &rsquo;em have their stamps?&rdquo; suggests 
the assistant, with a burst of inspiration; &ldquo;perhaps it 
will get rid of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Why the Man in Uniform has, generally, sad Eyes.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; wearily replies the older 
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;There will only come a fresh crowd when those 
are gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; argues the other, &ldquo;that will be 
a change, anyhow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m tired of looking at this 
lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put it to a German post-office clerk once&mdash;a man I had 
been boring for months.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I write these letters&mdash;these short 
stories, these three-act plays&mdash;on purpose to annoy 
you.&nbsp; Do let me try to get the idea out of your head.&nbsp; 
Personally, I hate work&mdash;hate it as much as you do.&nbsp; 
This is a pleasant little town of yours: given a free choice, I 
could spend the whole day mooning round it, never putting pen to 
paper.&nbsp; But what am I to do?&nbsp; I have a wife and 
children.&nbsp; You know what it is yourself: they clamour for 
food, boots&mdash;all sorts of things.&nbsp; I have to prepare 
these little packets for sale and bring them to you to send 
off.&nbsp; You see, you are here.&nbsp; If you were not 
here&mdash;if there were no post-office in this town, maybe 
I&rsquo;d have to train pigeons, or cork the thing up in a 
bottle, fling it into the river, and trust to luck and the Gulf 
Stream.&nbsp; But, you being here, and calling yourself a 
post-office&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s a temptation to a 
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think it did good.&nbsp; Anyhow, after that he used to grin 
when I opened the door, instead of greeting me as formerly with a
face the picture of despair.&nbsp; But to return to our 
inexperienced friend.</p>
<p>At last the wicket is suddenly opened.&nbsp; A peremptory 
official demands of him &ldquo;name and address.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not
expecting the question, he is a little doubtful of his address, 
and has to correct himself once or twice.&nbsp; The official eyes
him suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name of mother?&rdquo; continues the official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; repeats the official.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had a
mother of some sort, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is a man who loved his mother sincerely while she lived, 
but she has been dead these twenty years, and, for the life of 
him he cannot recollect her name.&nbsp; He thinks it was Margaret
Henrietta, but is not at all sure.&nbsp; Besides, what on earth 
has his mother got to do with this registered letter that he 
wants to send to his partner in New York?</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did it die?&rdquo; asks the official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did what die?&nbsp; Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What child?&rdquo;&nbsp; The indignation of the 
official is almost picturesque.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I want to do,&rdquo; explains your friend, 
&ldquo;is to register a letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This letter, I want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The window is slammed in his face.&nbsp; When, ten minutes 
later he does reach the right wicket&mdash;the bureau for the 
registration of letters, and not the bureau for the registration 
of infantile deaths&mdash;it is pointed out to him that the 
letter either is sealed or that it is not sealed.</p>
<p>I have never been able yet to solve this problem.&nbsp; If 
your letter is sealed, it then appears that it ought not to have 
been sealed.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you have omitted to seal it, that is 
your fault.&nbsp; In any case, the letter cannot go as it 
is.&nbsp; The continental official brings up the public on the 
principle of the nurse who sent the eldest girl to see what Tommy
was doing and tell him he mustn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Your friend, 
having wasted half an hour and mislaid his temper for the day, 
decides to leave this thing over and talk to the hotel porter 
about it.&nbsp; Next to the Burgomeister, the hotel porter is the
most influential man in the continental town: maybe because he 
can swear in seven different languages.&nbsp; But even he is not 
omnipotent.</p>
<h3>The Traveller&rsquo;s one Friend.</h3>
<p>Three of us, on the point of starting for a walking tour 
through the Tyrol, once sent on our luggage by post from 
Constance to Innsbruck.&nbsp; Our idea was that, reaching 
Innsbruck in the height of the season, after a week&rsquo;s tramp
on two flannel shirts and a change of socks, we should be glad to
get into fresh clothes before showing ourselves in civilized 
society.&nbsp; Our bags were waiting for us in the post-office: 
we could see them through the grating.&nbsp; But some 
informality&mdash;I have never been able to understand what it 
was&mdash;had occurred at Constance.&nbsp; The suspicion of the 
Swiss postal authorities had been aroused, and special 
instructions had been sent that the bags were to be delivered up 
only to their rightful owners.</p>
<p>It sounds sensible enough.&nbsp; Nobody wants his bag 
delivered up to anyone else.&nbsp; But it had not been explained 
to the authorities at Innsbruck how they were to know the proper 
owners.&nbsp; Three wretched-looking creatures crawled into the 
post-office and said they wanted those three 
bags&mdash;&ldquo;those bags, there in the 
corner&rdquo;&mdash;which happened to be nice, clean, 
respectable-looking bags, the sort of bags that anyone might 
want.&nbsp; One of them produced a bit of paper, it is true, 
which he said had been given to him as a receipt by the 
post-office people at Constance.&nbsp; But in the lonely passes 
of the Tyrol one man, set upon by three, might easily be robbed 
of his papers, and his body thrown over a precipice.&nbsp; The 
chief clerk shook his head.&nbsp; He would like us to return 
accompanied by someone who could identify us.&nbsp; The hotel 
porter occurred to us, as a matter of course.&nbsp; Keeping to 
the back streets, we returned to the hotel and fished him out of 
his box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mr. J.,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;this is my friend 
Mr. B. and this is Mr. S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The porter bowed and said he was delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to come with us to the post-office,&rdquo; I
explained, &ldquo;and identify us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hotel porter is always a practical man: his calling robs 
him of all sympathy with the hide-bound formality of his 
compatriots.&nbsp; He put on his cap and accompanied us back to 
the office.&nbsp; He did his best: no one could say he did 
not.&nbsp; He told them who we were: they asked him how he 
knew.&nbsp; For reply he asked them how they thought he knew his 
mother: he just knew us: it was second nature with him.&nbsp; He 
implied that the question was a silly one, and suggested that, as
his time was valuable, they should hand us over the three bags 
and have done with their nonsense.</p>
<p>They asked him how long he had known us.&nbsp; He threw up his
hands with an eloquent gesture: memory refused to travel back 
such distance.&nbsp; It appeared there was never a time when he 
had not known us.&nbsp; We had been boys together.</p>
<p>Did he know anybody else who knew us?&nbsp; The question 
appeared to him almost insulting.&nbsp; Everybody in Innsbruck 
knew us, honoured us, respected us&mdash;everybody, that is, 
except a few post-office officials, people quite out of 
society.</p>
<p>Would he kindly bring along, say; one undoubtedly respectable 
citizen who could vouch for our identity?&nbsp; The request 
caused him to forget us and our troubles.&nbsp; The argument 
became a personal quarrel between the porter and the clerk.&nbsp;
If he, the porter, was not a respectable citizen of Innsbruck, 
where was such an one to be found?</p>
<h3>The disadvantage of being an unknown Person.</h3>
<p>Both gentlemen became excited, and the discussion passed 
beyond my understanding.&nbsp; But I gathered dimly from what the
clerk said, that ill-natured remarks relative to the 
porter&rsquo;s grandfather and a missing cow had never yet been 
satisfactorily replied to: and, from observations made by the 
porter, that stories were in circulation about the clerk&rsquo;s 
aunt and a sergeant of artillery that should suggest to a 
discreet nephew of the lady the inadvisability of talking about 
other people&rsquo;s grandfathers.</p>
<p>Our sympathies were naturally with the porter: he was our man,
but he did not seem to be advancing our cause much.&nbsp; We left
them quarrelling, and persuaded the head waiter that evening to 
turn out the gas at our end of the <i>table 
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>.</p>
<p>The next morning we returned to the post-office by 
ourselves.&nbsp; The clerk proved a reasonable man when treated 
in a friendly spirit.&nbsp; He was a bit of a climber 
himself.&nbsp; He admitted the possibility of our being the 
rightful owners.&nbsp; His instructions were only not to 
<i>deliver up</i> the bags, and he himself suggested a way out of
the difficulty.&nbsp; We might come each day and dress in the 
post-office, behind the screen.&nbsp; It was an awkward 
arrangement, even although the clerk allowed us the use of the 
back door.&nbsp; And occasionally, in spite of the utmost care, 
bits of us would show outside the screen.&nbsp; But for a couple 
of days, until the British Consul returned from Salzburg, the 
post-office had to be our dressing room.&nbsp; The continental 
official, I am inclined to think, errs on the side of 
prudence.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>If only we had not lost our Tails!</h3>
<p>A friend of mine thinks it a pity that we have lost our 
tails.&nbsp; He argues it would be so helpful if, like the dog, 
we possessed a tail that wagged when we were pleased, that stuck 
out straight when we were feeling mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, do come and see us again soon,&rdquo; says our 
hostess; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t wait to be asked.&nbsp; Drop in 
whenever you are passing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We take her at her word.&nbsp; The servant who answers our 
knocking says she &ldquo;will see.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a 
scuffling of feet, a murmur of hushed voices, a swift opening and
closing of doors.&nbsp; We are shown into the drawing-room, the 
maid, breathless from her search, one supposes, having discovered
that her mistress <i>is</i> at home.&nbsp; We stand upon the 
hearthrug, clinging to our hat and stick as to things friendly 
and sympathetic: the suggestion forcing itself upon us is that of
a visit to the dentist.</p>
<p>Our hostess enters wreathed in smiles.&nbsp; Is she really 
pleased to see us, or is she saying to herself, &ldquo;Drat the 
man!&nbsp; Why must he choose the very morning I had intended to 
fix up the clean curtains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she has to pretend to be delighted, and ask us to stay to 
lunch.&nbsp; It would save us hours of anxiety could we look 
beyond her smiling face to her tail peeping out saucily from a 
placket-hole.&nbsp; Is it wagging, or is it standing out rigid at
right angles from her skirt?</p>
<p>But I fear by this time we should have taught our tails polite
behaviour.&nbsp; We should have schooled them to wag 
enthusiastically the while we were growling savagely to 
ourselves.&nbsp; Man put on insincerity to hide his mind when he 
made himself a garment of fig-leaves to hide his body.</p>
<p>One sometimes wonders whether he has gained so very 
much.&nbsp; A small acquaintance of mine is being brought up on 
strange principles.&nbsp; Whether his parents are mad or not is a
matter of opinion.&nbsp; Their ideas are certainly 
peculiar.&nbsp; They encourage him rather than otherwise to tell 
the truth on all occasions.&nbsp; I am watching the experiment 
with interest.&nbsp; If you ask him what he thinks of you, he 
tells you.&nbsp; Some people don&rsquo;t ask him a second 
time.&nbsp; They say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a very rude little boy you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you insisted upon it,&rdquo; he explains; &ldquo;I 
told you I&rsquo;d rather not say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It does not comfort them in the least.&nbsp; Yet the result 
is, he is already an influence.&nbsp; People who have braved the 
ordeal, and emerged successfully, go about with swelled head.</p>
<h3>And little Boys would always tell the Truth!</h3>
<p>Politeness would seem to have been invented for the comfort of
the undeserving.&nbsp; We let fall our rain of compliments upon 
the unjust and the just without distinction.&nbsp; Every hostess 
has provided us with the most charming evening of our life.&nbsp;
Every guest has conferred a like blessing upon us by accepting 
our invitation.&nbsp; I remember a dear good lady in a small 
south German town organizing for one winter&rsquo;s day a 
sleighing party to the woods.&nbsp; A sleighing party differs 
from a picnic.&nbsp; The people who want each other cannot go off
together and lose themselves, leaving the bores to find only each
other.&nbsp; You are in close company from early morn till late 
at night.&nbsp; We were to drive twenty miles, six in a sledge, 
dine together in a lonely <i>Wirtschaft</i>, dance and sing 
songs, and afterwards drive home by moonlight.&nbsp; Success 
depends on every member of the company fitting into his place and
assisting in the general harmony.&nbsp; Our chieftainess was 
fixing the final arrangements the evening before in the 
drawing-room of the <i>pension</i>.&nbsp; One place was still to 
spare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tompkins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two voices uttered the name simultaneously; three others 
immediately took up the refrain.&nbsp; Tompkins was our 
man&mdash;the cheeriest, merriest companion imaginable.&nbsp; 
Tompkins alone could be trusted to make the affair a 
success.&nbsp; Tompkins, who had only arrived that afternoon, was
pointed out to our chieftainess.&nbsp; We could hear his 
good-tempered laugh from where we sat, grouped together at the 
other end of the room.&nbsp; Our chieftainess rose, and made for 
him direct.</p>
<p>Alas! she was a short-sighted lady&mdash;we had not thought of
that.&nbsp; She returned in triumph, followed by a dismal-looking
man I had met the year before in the Black Forest, and had hoped 
never to meet again.&nbsp; I drew her aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you do,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask 
--- &rdquo; (I forget his name.&nbsp; One of these days 
I&rsquo;ll forget him altogether, and be happier.&nbsp; I will 
call him Johnson.)&nbsp; &ldquo;He would turn the whole thing 
into a funeral before we were half-way there.&nbsp; I climbed a 
mountain with him once.&nbsp; He makes you forget all your other 
troubles; that is the only thing he is good for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who is Johnson?&rdquo; she demanded.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s Johnson,&rdquo; I 
explained&mdash;&ldquo;the thing you&rsquo;ve brought over.&nbsp;
Why on earth didn&rsquo;t you leave it alone?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
your woman&rsquo;s instinct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I thought it 
was Tompkins.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve invited him, and he&rsquo;s 
accepted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was a stickler for politeness, and would not hear of his 
being told that he had been mistaken for an agreeable man, but 
that the error, most fortunately, had been discovered in 
time.&nbsp; He started a row with the driver of the sledge, and 
devoted the journey outwards to an argument on the fiscal 
question.&nbsp; He told the proprietor of the hotel what he 
thought of German cooking, and insisted on having the windows 
open.&nbsp; One of our party&mdash;a German student&mdash;sang, 
&ldquo;Deutschland, Deutschland &uuml;ber 
alles,&rdquo;&mdash;which led to a heated discussion on the 
proper place of sentiment in literature, and a general 
denunciation by Johnson of Teutonic characteristics in 
general.&nbsp; We did not dance.&nbsp; Johnson said that, of 
course, he spoke only for himself, but the sight of middle-aged 
ladies and gentlemen catching hold of each other round the middle
and jigging about like children was to him rather a saddening 
spectacle, but to the young such gambolling was natural.&nbsp; 
Let the young ones indulge themselves.&nbsp; Only four of our 
party could claim to be under thirty with any hope of 
success.&nbsp; They were kind enough not to impress the fact upon
us.&nbsp; Johnson enlivened the journey back by a searching 
analysis of enjoyment: Of what did it really consist?</p>
<p>Yet, on wishing him &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; our chieftainess
thanked him for his company in precisely the same terms she would
have applied to Tompkins, who, by unflagging good humour and 
tact, would have made the day worth remembering to us all for all
time.</p>
<h3>And everyone obtained his just Deserts!</h3>
<p>We pay dearly for our want of sincerity.&nbsp; We are denied 
the payment of praise: it has ceased to have any value.&nbsp; 
People shake me warmly by the hand and tell me that they like my 
books.&nbsp; It only bores me.&nbsp; Not that I am superior to 
compliment&mdash;nobody is&mdash;but because I cannot be sure 
that they mean it.&nbsp; They would say just the same had they 
never read a line I had written.&nbsp; If I visit a house and 
find a book of mine open face downwards on the window-seat, it 
sends no thrill of pride through my suspicious mind.&nbsp; As 
likely as not, I tell myself, the following is the conversation 
that has taken place between my host and hostess the day before 
my arrival:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that man J--- is coming down 
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&nbsp; I wish you would tell me of these 
things a little earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did tell you&mdash;told you last week.&nbsp; Your 
memory gets worse every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly never told me, or I should have 
remembered it.&nbsp; Is he anybody important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; writes books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of books?&mdash;I mean, is he quite 
respectable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, or I should not have invited him.&nbsp; 
These sort of people go everywhere nowadays.&nbsp; By the by, 
have we got any of his books about the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll look and 
see.&nbsp; If you had let me know in time I could have ordered 
one from Mudie&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got to go to town; I&rsquo;ll make 
sure of it, and buy one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems a pity to waste money.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you be 
going anywhere near Mudie&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks more appreciative to have bought a copy.&nbsp; It
will do for a birthday present for someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the conversation may have been very 
different.&nbsp; My hostess may have said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I <i>am</i> glad he&rsquo;s coming.&nbsp; I have 
been longing to meet him for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She may have bought my book on the day of publication, and be 
reading it through for the second time.&nbsp; She may, by pure 
accident, have left it on her favourite seat beneath the 
window.&nbsp; The knowledge that insincerity is our universal 
garment has reduced all compliment to meaningless formula.&nbsp; 
A lady one evening at a party drew me aside.&nbsp; The chief 
guest&mdash;a famous writer&mdash;had just arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have so little time 
for reading, what has he done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was on the point of replying when an inveterate wag, who had
overheard her, interposed between us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Cloister and the Hearth,&rsquo;&rdquo; he 
told her, &ldquo;and &lsquo;Adam Bede.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He happened to know the lady well.&nbsp; She has a good heart,
but was ever muddle-headed.&nbsp; She thanked that wag with a 
smile, and I heard her later in the evening boring most evidently
that literary lion with elongated praise of the &ldquo;Cloister 
and the Hearth&rdquo; and &ldquo;Adam Bede.&rdquo;&nbsp; They 
were among the few books she had ever read, and talking about 
them came easily to her.&nbsp; She told me afterwards that she 
had found that literary lion a charming man, but&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;he has got a good 
opinion of himself.&nbsp; He told me he considered both books 
among the finest in the English language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is as well always to make a note of the author&rsquo;s 
name.&nbsp; Some people never do&mdash;more particularly 
playgoers.&nbsp; A well-known dramatic author told me he once 
took a couple of colonial friends to a play of his own.&nbsp; It 
was after a little dinner at Kettner&rsquo;s; they suggested the 
theatre, and he thought he would give them a treat.&nbsp; He did 
not mention to them that he was the author, and they never looked
at the programme.&nbsp; Their faces as the play proceeded 
lengthened; it did not seem to be their school of comedy.&nbsp; 
At the end of the first act they sprang to their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s chuck this rot,&rdquo; suggested one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the Empire,&rdquo; suggested the 
other.&nbsp; The well-known dramatist followed them out.&nbsp; He
thinks the fault must have been with the dinner.</p>
<p>A young friend of mine&mdash;a man of good 
family&mdash;contracted a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>: that is, he 
married the daughter of a Canadian farmer, a frank, amiable girl,
bewitchingly pretty, with more character in her little finger 
than some girls possess in their whole body.&nbsp; I met him one 
day, some three months after his return to London.</p>
<h3>And only people would do Parlour Tricks who do them 
well!</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;how is it 
shaping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is the dearest girl in the world,&rdquo; he 
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has only got one fault; she believes 
what people say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will get over that,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she does,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s 
awkward at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see it leading her into difficulty,&rdquo; I 
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not accomplished,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; He 
seemed to wish to talk about it to a sympathetic listener.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;She never pretended to be accomplished.&nbsp; I did not 
marry her for her accomplishments.&nbsp; But now she is beginning
to think she must have been accomplished all the time, without 
knowing it.&nbsp; She plays the piano like a schoolgirl on a 
parents&rsquo; visiting-day.&nbsp; She told them she did not 
play&mdash;not worth listening to&mdash;at least, she began by 
telling them so.&nbsp; They insisted that she did, that they had 
heard about her playing, and were thirsting to enjoy it.&nbsp; 
She is good nature itself.&nbsp; She would stand on her head if 
she thought it would give real joy to anyone.&nbsp; She took it 
they really wanted to hear her, and so let &rsquo;em have 
it.&nbsp; They tell her that her touch is something quite out of 
the common&mdash;which is the truth, if only she could understand
it&mdash;why did she never think of taking up music as a 
profession?&nbsp; By this time she is wondering herself that she 
never did.&nbsp; They are not satisfied with hearing her 
once.&nbsp; They ask for more, and they get it.&nbsp; The other 
evening I had to keep quiet on my chair while she thumped through
four pieces one after the other, including the Beethoven 
Sonata.&nbsp; We knew it was the Beethoven Sonata.&nbsp; She told
us before she started it was going to be the Beethoven Sonata, 
otherwise, for all any of us could have guessed, it might have 
been the &lsquo;Battle of Prague.&rsquo;&nbsp; We all sat round 
with wooden faces, staring at our boots.&nbsp; Afterwards those 
of them that couldn&rsquo;t get near enough to her to make a fool
of her crowded round me.&nbsp; Wanted to know why I had never 
told them I had discovered a musical prodigy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll 
lose my temper one day and pull somebody&rsquo;s nose, I feel I 
shall.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got a recitation; whether intended to be
serious or comic I had never been able to make up my mind.&nbsp; 
The way she gives it confers upon it all the disadvantages of 
both.&nbsp; It is chiefly concerned with an angel and a 
child.&nbsp; But a dog comes into it about the middle, and from 
that point onward it is impossible to tell who is 
talking&mdash;sometimes you think it is the angel, and then it 
sounds more like the dog.&nbsp; The child is the easiest to 
follow: it talks all the time through its nose.&nbsp; If I have 
heard that recitation once I have heard it fifty times; and now 
she is busy learning an encore.</p>
<h3>And all the World had Sense!</h3>
<p>&ldquo;What hurts me most,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is having
to watch her making herself ridiculous.&nbsp; Yet what am I to 
do?&nbsp; If I explain things to her she will be miserable and 
ashamed of herself; added to which her frankness&mdash;perhaps 
her greatest charm&mdash;will be murdered.&nbsp; The trouble runs
through everything.&nbsp; She won&rsquo;t take my advice about 
her frocks.&nbsp; She laughs, and repeats to me&mdash;well, the 
lies that other women tell a girl who is spoiling herself by 
dressing absurdly; especially when she is a pretty girl and they 
are anxious she should go on spoiling herself.&nbsp; She bought a
hat last week, one day when I was not with her.&nbsp; It only 
wants the candles to look like a Christmas tree.&nbsp; They 
insist on her taking it off so they may examine it more closely, 
with the idea of having one built like it for themselves; and she
sits by delighted, and explains to them the secret of the 
thing.&nbsp; We get to parties half an hour before the opening 
time; she is afraid of being a minute late.&nbsp; They have told 
her that the party can&rsquo;t begin without 
her&mdash;isn&rsquo;t worth calling a party till she&rsquo;s 
there.&nbsp; We are always the last to go.&nbsp; The other people
don&rsquo;t matter, but if she goes they will feel the whole 
thing has been a failure.&nbsp; She is dead for want of sleep, 
and they are sick and tired of us; but if I look at my watch they
talk as if their hearts were breaking, and she thinks me a brute 
for wanting to leave friends so passionately attached to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do we all play this silly game; what is the sense 
of it?&rdquo; he wanted to know.</p>
<p>I could not tell him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>Fire and the Foreigner.</h3>
<p>They are odd folk, these foreigners.&nbsp; There are moments 
of despair when I almost give them up&mdash;feel I don&rsquo;t 
care what becomes of them&mdash;feel as if I could let them 
muddle on in their own way&mdash;wash my hands of them, so to 
speak, and attend exclusively to my own business: we all have our
days of feebleness.&nbsp; They will sit outside a caf&eacute; on 
a freezing night, with an east wind blowing, and play 
dominoes.&nbsp; They will stand outside a tramcar, rushing 
through the icy air at fifteen miles an hour, and refuse to go 
inside, even to oblige a lady.&nbsp; Yet in railway carriages, in
which you could grill a bloater by the simple process of laying 
it underneath the seat, they will insist on the window being 
closed, light cigars to keep their noses warm, and sit with the 
collars of their fur coats buttoned up around their necks.</p>
<p>In their houses they keep the double windows hermetically 
sealed for three or four months at a time: and the hot air 
quivering about the stoves scorches your face if you venture 
nearer to it than a yard.&nbsp; Travel can broaden the 
mind.&nbsp; It can also suggest to the Britisher that in some 
respects his countrymen are nothing near so silly as they are 
supposed to be.&nbsp; There was a time when I used to sit with my
legs stretched out before the English coal fire and listen with 
respectful attention while people who I thought knew all about it
explained to me how wicked and how wasteful were our methods.</p>
<p>All the heat from that fire, they told me, was going up the 
chimney.&nbsp; I did not like to answer them that notwithstanding
I felt warm and cosy.&nbsp; I feared it might be merely British 
stupidity that kept me warm and cosy, not the fire at all.&nbsp; 
How could it be the fire?&nbsp; The heat from the fire was going 
up the chimney.&nbsp; It was the glow of ignorance that was 
making my toes tingle.&nbsp; Besides, if by sitting close in 
front of the fire and looking hard at it, I did contrive, by 
hypnotic suggestion, maybe, to fancy myself warm, what should I 
feel like at the other end of the room?</p>
<p>It seemed like begging the question to reply that I had no 
particular use for the other end of the room, that generally 
speaking there was room enough about the fire for all the people 
I really cared for, that sitting altogether round the fire seemed
quite as sensible as sulking by one&rsquo;s self in a corner the 
other end of the room, that the fire made a cheerful and 
convenient focus for family and friends.&nbsp; They pointed out 
to me how a stove, blocking up the centre of the room, with a 
dingy looking fluepipe wandering round the ceiling, would enable 
us to sit ranged round the walls, like patients in a hospital 
waiting-room, and use up coke and potato-peelings.</p>
<p>Since then I have had practical experience of the scientific 
stove.&nbsp; I want the old-fashioned, unsanitary, wasteful, 
illogical, open fireplace.&nbsp; I want the heat to go up the 
chimney, instead of stopping in the room and giving me a 
headache, and making everything go round.&nbsp; When I come in 
out of the snow I want to see a fire&mdash;something that says to
me with a cheerful crackle, &ldquo;Hallo, old man, cold outside, 
isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Come and sit down.&nbsp; Come quite close 
and warm your hands.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right, put your foot 
under him and persuade him to move a yard or two.&nbsp; 
That&rsquo;s all he&rsquo;s been doing for the last hour, lying 
there roasting himself, lazy little devil.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll get 
softening of the spine, that&rsquo;s what will happen to 
him.&nbsp; Put your toes on the fender.&nbsp; The tea will be 
here in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>My British Stupidity.</h3>
<p>I want something that I can toast my back against, while 
standing with coat tails tucked up and my hands in my pockets, 
explaining things to people.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want a 
comfortless, staring, white thing, in a corner of the room, 
behind the sofa&mdash;a thing that looks and smells like a family
tomb.&nbsp; It may be hygienic, and it may be hot, but it does 
not seem to do me any good.&nbsp; It has its advantages: it 
contains a cupboard into which you can put things to dry.&nbsp; 
You can also forget them, and leave them there.&nbsp; Then people
complain of a smell of burning, and hope the house is not on 
fire, and you ease their mind by explaining to them that it is 
probably only your boots.&nbsp; Complicated internal arrangements
are worked by a key.&nbsp; If you put on too much fuel, and do 
not work this key properly, the thing explodes.&nbsp; And if you 
do not put on any coal at all and the fire goes out suddenly, 
then likewise it explodes.&nbsp; That is the only way it knows of
calling attention to itself.&nbsp; On the Continent you know when
the fire wants seeing to merely by listening:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounded like the dining-room, that last 
explosion,&rdquo; somebody remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; observes another, &ldquo;I 
distinctly felt the shock behind me&mdash;my bedroom, I 
expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bits of ceiling begin to fall, and you notice that the mirror 
over the sideboard is slowly coming towards you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it must be this stove,&rdquo; you say; 
&ldquo;curious how difficult it is to locate sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You snatch up the children and hurry out of the room.&nbsp; 
After a while, when things have settled down, you venture to look
in again.&nbsp; Maybe it was only a mild explosion.&nbsp; A 
ten-pound note and a couple of plumbers in the house for a week 
will put things right again.&nbsp; They tell me they are 
economical, these German stoves, but you have got to understand 
them.&nbsp; I think I have learnt the trick of them at last: and 
I don&rsquo;t suppose, all told, it has cost me more than fifty 
pounds.&nbsp; And now I am trying to teach the rest of the 
family.&nbsp; What I complain about the family is that they do 
not seem anxious to learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do it,&rdquo; they say, pressing the coal scoop 
into my hand: &ldquo;it makes us nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a pretty, patriarchal idea: I stand between the 
trusting, admiring family and these explosive stoves that are the
terror of their lives.&nbsp; They gather round me in a group and 
watch me, the capable, all-knowing Head who fears no foreign 
stove.&nbsp; But there are days when I get tired of going round 
making up fires.</p>
<p>Nor is it sufficient to understand only one particular 
stove.&nbsp; The practical foreigner prides himself upon having 
various stoves, adapted to various work.&nbsp; Hitherto I have 
been speaking only of the stove supposed to be best suited to 
reception rooms and bedrooms.&nbsp; The hall is provided with 
another sort of stove altogether: an iron stove this, that turns 
up its nose at coke and potato-peelings.&nbsp; If you give it 
anything else but the best coal it explodes.&nbsp; It is like 
living surrounded by peppery old colonels, trying to pass a 
peaceful winter among these passionate stoves.&nbsp; There is a 
stove in the kitchen to be used only for roasting: this one will 
not look at anything else but wood.&nbsp; Give it a bit of coal, 
meaning to be kind, and before you are out of the room it has 
exploded.</p>
<p>Then there is a trick stove specially popular in 
Belgium.&nbsp; It has a little door at the top and another little
door at the bottom, and looks like a pepper-caster.&nbsp; Whether
it is happy or not depends upon those two little doors.&nbsp; 
There are times when it feels it wants the bottom door shut and 
the top door open, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, or both open at 
the same time, or both shut&mdash;it is a fussy little stove.</p>
<p>Ordinary intelligence does not help you much with this 
stove.&nbsp; You want to be bred in the country.&nbsp; It is a 
question of instinct: you have to have Belgian blood in your 
veins to get on comfortably with it.&nbsp; On the whole, it is a 
mild little stove, this Belgian pet.&nbsp; It does not often 
explode: it only gets angry, and throws its cover into the air, 
and flings hot coals about the room.&nbsp; It lives, generally 
speaking, inside an iron cupboard with two doors.&nbsp; When you 
want it, you open these doors, and pull it out into the 
room.&nbsp; It works on a swivel.&nbsp; And when you don&rsquo;t 
want it you try to push it back again, and then the whole thing 
tumbles over, and the girl throws her hands up to Heaven and 
says, &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; and screams for the cook and the 
<i>femme journ&eacute;e</i>, and they all three say &ldquo;Mon 
Dieu!&rdquo; and fall upon it with buckets of water.&nbsp; By the
time everything has been extinguished you have made up your mind 
to substitute for it just the ordinary explosive stove to which 
you are accustomed.</p>
<h3>I am considered Cold and Mad.</h3>
<p>In your own house you can, of course, open the windows, and 
thus defeat the foreign stove.&nbsp; The rest of the street 
thinks you mad, but then the Englishman is considered by all 
foreigners to be always mad.&nbsp; It is his privilege to be 
mad.&nbsp; The street thinks no worse of you than it did before, 
and you can breathe in comfort.&nbsp; But in the railway carriage
they don&rsquo;t allow you to be mad.&nbsp; In Europe, unless you
are prepared to draw at sight upon the other passengers, throw 
the conductor out of the window, and take the train in by 
yourself, it is useless arguing the question of fresh air.&nbsp; 
The rule abroad is that if any one man objects to the window 
being open, the window remains closed.&nbsp; He does not quarrel 
with you: he rings the bell, and points out to the conductor that
the temperature of the carriage has sunk to little more than 
ninety degrees, Fahrenheit.&nbsp; He thinks a window must be 
open.</p>
<p>The conductor is generally an old soldier: he understands 
being shot, he understands being thrown out of window, but not 
the laws of sanitation.&nbsp; If, as I have explained, you shoot 
him, or throw him out on the permanent way, that convinces 
him.&nbsp; He leaves you to discuss the matter with the second 
conductor, who, by your action, has now, of course, become the 
first conductor.&nbsp; As there are generally half a dozen of 
these conductors scattered about the train, the process of 
educating them becomes monotonous.&nbsp; You generally end by 
submitting to the law.</p>
<p>Unless you happen to be an American woman.&nbsp; Never did my 
heart go out more gladly to America as a nation than one spring 
day travelling from Berne to Vevey.&nbsp; We had been sitting for
an hour in an atmosphere that would have rendered a Dante 
disinclined to notice things.&nbsp; Dante, after ten minutes in 
that atmosphere, would have lost all interest in the show.&nbsp; 
He would not have asked questions.&nbsp; He would have whispered 
to Virgil:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me out of this, old man, there&rsquo;s a good 
fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Sometimes I wish I were an American Woman.</h3>
<p>The carriage was crowded, chiefly with Germans.&nbsp; Every 
window was closed, every ventilator shut.&nbsp; The hot air 
quivered round our feet.&nbsp; Seventeen men and four women were 
smoking, two children were sucking peppermints, and an old 
married couple were eating their lunch, consisting chiefly of 
garlic.&nbsp; At a junction, the door was thrown open.&nbsp; The 
foreigner opens the door a little way, glides in, and closes it 
behind him.&nbsp; This was not a foreigner, but an American lady,
<i>en voyage</i>, accompanied by five other American 
ladies.&nbsp; They marched in carrying packages.&nbsp; They could
not find six seats together, so they scattered up and down the 
carriage.&nbsp; The first thing that each woman did, the moment 
she could get her hands free, was to dash for the nearest window 
and haul it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Astonishes me,&rdquo; said the first woman, &ldquo;that
somebody is not dead in this carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their idea, I think, was that through asphyxiation we had 
become comatose, and, but for their entrance, would have died 
unconscious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a current of air that is wanted,&rdquo; said 
another of the ladies.</p>
<p>So they opened the door at the front of the carriage and four 
of them stood outside on the platform, chatting pleasantly and 
admiring the scenery, while two of them opened the door at the 
other end, and took photographs of the Lake of Geneva.&nbsp; The 
carriage rose and cursed them in six languages.&nbsp; Bells were 
rung: conductors came flying in.&nbsp; It was all of no 
use.&nbsp; Those American ladies were cheerful but firm.&nbsp; 
They argued with volubility: they argued standing in the open 
doorway.&nbsp; The conductors, familiar, no doubt, with the 
American lady and her ways, shrugged their shoulders and 
retired.&nbsp; The other passengers undid their bags and bundles,
and wrapped themselves up in shawls and Jaeger nightshirts.</p>
<p>I met the ladies afterwards in Lausanne.&nbsp; They told me 
they had been condemned to a fine of forty francs apiece.&nbsp; 
They also explained to me that they had not the slightest 
intention of paying it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>Too much Postcard.</h3>
<p>The postcard craze is dying out in Germany&mdash;the land of 
its birth&mdash;I am told.&nbsp; In Germany they do things 
thoroughly, or not at all.&nbsp; The German when he took to 
sending postcards abandoned almost every other pursuit in 
life.&nbsp; The German tourist never knew where he had been until
on reaching home again he asked some friend or relation to allow 
him to look over the postcards he had sent.&nbsp; Then it was he 
began to enjoy his trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a charming old town!&rdquo; the German tourist 
would exclaim.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I could have found time while 
I was there to have gone outside the hotel and have had a look 
round.&nbsp; Still, it is pleasant to think one has been 
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you did not have much time?&rdquo; his friend
would suggest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did not get there till the evening,&rdquo; the 
tourist would explain.&nbsp; &ldquo;We were busy till dark buying
postcards, and then in the morning there was the writing and 
addressing to be done, and when that was over, and we had had our
breakfast, it was time to leave again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would take up another card showing the panorama from a 
mountain top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sublime! colossal!&rdquo; he would cry 
enraptured.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had known it was anything like 
that, I&rsquo;d have stopped another day and had a look at 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was always worth seeing, the arrival of a party of German 
tourists in a Schwartzwald village.&nbsp; Leaping from the coach 
they would surge round the solitary gendarme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the postcard shop?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell 
us&mdash;we have only two hours&mdash;where do we get 
postcards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gendarme, scenting <i>Trinkgeld</i>, would head them at 
the double-quick: stout old gentlemen unaccustomed to the 
double-quick, stouter Frauen gathering up their skirts with utter
disregard to all propriety, slim <i>Fr&auml;ulein</i> clinging to
their beloved would run after him.&nbsp; Nervous pedestrians 
would fly for safety into doorways, careless loiterers would be 
swept into the gutter.</p>
<p>In the narrow doorway of the postcard shop trouble would 
begin.&nbsp; The cries of suffocated women and trampled children,
the curses of strong men, would rend the air.&nbsp; The German is
a peaceful, law-abiding citizen, but in the hunt for postcards he
was a beast.&nbsp; A woman would pounce on a tray of cards, 
commence selecting, suddenly the tray would be snatched from 
her.&nbsp; She would burst into tears, and hit the person nearest
to her with her umbrella.&nbsp; The cunning and the strong would 
secure the best cards.&nbsp; The weak and courteous be left with 
pictures of post offices and railway stations.&nbsp; Torn and 
dishevelled, the crowd would rush back to the hotel, sweep 
crockery from the table, and&mdash;sucking stumpy 
pencils&mdash;write feverishly.&nbsp; A hurried meal would 
follow.&nbsp; Then the horses would be put to again, the German 
tourists would climb back to their places and be driven away, 
asking of the coachman what the name of the place they had just 
left might happen to be.</p>
<h3>The Postcard as a Family Curse.</h3>
<p>One presumes that even to the patient German the thing grew 
tiresome.&nbsp; In the <i>Fliegende Bl&auml;tter</i> two young 
clerks were represented discussing the question of summer 
holidays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asks A of B.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere,&rdquo; answers B.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you afford it?&rdquo; asks the sympathetic 
A.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only been able to save up enough for the 
postcards,&rdquo; answers B, gloomily; &ldquo;no money left for 
the trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men and women carried bulky volumes containing the names and 
addresses of the people to whom they had promised to send 
cards.&nbsp; Everywhere, through winding forest glade, by silver 
sea, on mountain pathway, one met with prematurely aged looking 
tourists muttering as they walked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I send Aunt Gretchen a postcard from that last 
village that we stopped at, or did I address two to Cousin 
Lisa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, again, maybe, the picture postcard led to 
disappointment.&nbsp; Uninteresting towns clamoured, as 
ill-favoured spinsters in a photographic studio, to be made 
beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want,&rdquo; says the lady, &ldquo;a photograph my 
friends will really like.&nbsp; Some of these second-rate 
photographers make one look quite plain.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want
you to flatter me, if you understand, I merely want something 
nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The obliging photographer does his best.&nbsp; The nose is 
carefully toned down, the wart becomes a dimple, her own husband 
doesn&rsquo;t know her.&nbsp; The postcard artist has ended by 
imagining everything as it might have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were not for the houses,&rdquo; says the postcard
artist to himself, &ldquo;this might have been a picturesque old 
High street of medi&aelig;val aspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he draws a picture of the High street as it might have 
been.&nbsp; The lover of quaint architecture travels out of his 
way to see it, and when he finds it and contrasts it with the 
picture postcard he gets mad.&nbsp; I bought a postcard myself 
once representing the market place of a certain French 
town.&nbsp; It seemed to me, looking at the postcard, that I 
hadn&rsquo;t really seen France&mdash;not yet.&nbsp; I travelled 
nearly a hundred miles to see that market place.&nbsp; I was 
careful to arrive on market day and to get there at the right 
time.&nbsp; I reached the market square and looked at it.&nbsp; 
Then I asked a gendarme where it was.</p>
<p>He said it was there&mdash;that I was in it.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean this one, I want the other 
one, the picturesque one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said it was the only market square they had.&nbsp; I took 
the postcard from my pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are all the girls?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What girls?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<h3>The Artist&rsquo;s Dream.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Why, these girls;&rdquo; I showed him the postcard, 
there ought to have been about a hundred of them.&nbsp; There was
not a plain one among the lot.&nbsp; Many of them I should have 
called beautiful.&nbsp; They were selling flowers and fruit, all 
kinds of fruit&mdash;cherries, strawberries, rosy-cheeked apples,
luscious grapes&mdash;all freshly picked and sparkling with 
dew.&nbsp; The gendarme said he had never seen any 
girls&mdash;not in this particular square.&nbsp; Referring 
casually to the blood of saints and martyrs, he said he would 
like to see a few girls in that town worth looking at.&nbsp; In 
the square itself sat six motherly old souls round a 
lamp-post.&nbsp; One of them had a moustache, and was smoking a 
pipe, but in other respects, I have no doubt, was all a woman 
should be.&nbsp; Two of them were selling fish.&nbsp; That is 
they would have sold fish, no doubt, had anyone been there to buy
fish.&nbsp; The gaily clad thousands of eager purchasers pictured
in the postcard were represented by two workmen in blue blouses 
talking at a corner, mostly with their fingers; a small boy 
walking backwards, with the idea apparently of not missing 
anything behind him, and a yellow dog that sat on the kerb, and 
had given up all hope&mdash;judging from his expression&mdash;of 
anything ever happening again.&nbsp; With the gendarme and 
myself, these four were the only living creatures in the 
square.&nbsp; The rest of the market consisted of eggs and a few 
emaciated fowls hanging from a sort of broom handle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s the cathedral?&rdquo; I asked the 
gendarme.&nbsp; It was a Gothic structure in the postcard of 
evident antiquity.&nbsp; He said there had once been a 
cathedral.&nbsp; It was now a brewery; he pointed it out to 
me.&nbsp; He said he thought some portion of the original south 
wall had been retained.&nbsp; He thought the manager of the 
brewery might be willing to show it to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the fountain?&rdquo; I demanded, &ldquo;and all 
these doves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said there had been talk of a fountain.&nbsp; He believed 
the design had already been prepared.</p>
<p>I took the next train back.&nbsp; I do not now travel much out
of my way to see the original of the picture postcard.&nbsp; 
Maybe others have had like experience and the picture postcard as
a guide to the Continent has lost its value.</p>
<p>The dealer has fallen back upon the eternal feminine.&nbsp; 
The postcard collector is confined to girls.&nbsp; Through the 
kindness of correspondents I possess myself some fifty to a 
hundred girls, or perhaps it would be more correct to say one 
girl in fifty to a hundred different hats.&nbsp; I have her in 
big hats, I have her in small hats, I have her in no hat at 
all.&nbsp; I have her smiling, and I have her looking as if she 
had lost her last sixpence.&nbsp; I have her overdressed, I have 
her decidedly underdressed, but she is much the same girl.&nbsp; 
Very young men cannot have too many of her, but myself I am 
getting tired of her.&nbsp; I suppose it is the result of growing
old.</p>
<h3>Why not the Eternal Male for a change?</h3>
<p>Girls of my acquaintance are also beginning to grumble at 
her.&nbsp; I often think it hard on girls that the artist so 
neglects the eternal male.&nbsp; Why should there not be 
portraits of young men in different hats; young men in big hats, 
young men in little hats, young men smiling archly, young men 
looking noble.&nbsp; Girls don&rsquo;t want to decorate their 
rooms with pictures of other girls, they want rows of young men 
beaming down upon them.</p>
<p>But possibly I am sinning my mercies.&nbsp; A father hears 
what young men don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The girl in real life is 
feeling it keenly: the impossible standard set for her by the 
popular artist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real skirts don&rsquo;t hang like that,&rdquo; she 
grumbles, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not in the nature of skirts.&nbsp; 
You can&rsquo;t have feet that size.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t our 
fault, they are not made.&nbsp; Look at those waists!&nbsp; There
would be no room to put anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nature, in fashioning woman, has not yet crept up to 
the artistic ideal.&nbsp; The young man studies the picture on 
the postcard; on the coloured almanack given away at Christmas by
the local grocer; on the advertisement of Jones&rsquo; soap, and 
thinks with discontent of Polly Perkins, who in a natural way is 
as pretty a girl as can be looked for in this imperfect 
world.&nbsp; Thus it is that woman has had to take to shorthand 
and typewriting.&nbsp; Modern woman is being ruined by the 
artist.</p>
<h3>How Women are ruined by Art.</h3>
<p>Mr. Anstey tells a story of a young barber who fell in love 
with his own wax model.&nbsp; All day he dreamed of the 
impossible.&nbsp; She&mdash;the young lady of wax-like 
complexion, with her everlasting expression of dignity combined 
with amiability.&nbsp; No girl of his acquaintance could compete 
with her.&nbsp; If I remember rightly he died a bachelor, still 
dreaming of wax-like perfection.&nbsp; Perhaps it is as well we 
men are not handicapped to the same extent.&nbsp; If every 
hoarding, if every picture shop window, if every illustrated 
journal teemed with illustrations of the ideal young man in 
perfect fitting trousers that never bagged at the knees!&nbsp; 
Maybe it would result in our cooking our own breakfasts and 
making our own beds to the end of our lives.</p>
<p>The novelist and playwright, as it is, have made things 
difficult enough for us.&nbsp; In books and plays the young man 
makes love with a flow of language, a wealth of imagery, that 
must have taken him years to acquire.&nbsp; What does the 
novel-reading girl think, I wonder, when the real young man 
proposes to her!&nbsp; He has not called her anything in 
particular.&nbsp; Possibly he has got as far as suggesting she is
a duck or a daisy, or hinting shyly that she is his bee or his 
honeysuckle: in his excitement he is not quite sure which.&nbsp; 
In the novel she has been reading the hero has likened the 
heroine to half the vegetable kingdom.&nbsp; Elementary astronomy
has been exhausted in his attempt to describe to her the 
impression her appearance leaves on him.&nbsp; Bond Street has 
been sacked in his endeavour to get it clearly home to her what 
different parts of her are like&mdash;her eyes, her teeth, her 
heart, her hair, her ears.&nbsp; Delicacy alone prevents his 
extending the catalogue.&nbsp; A Fiji Island lover might possibly
go further.&nbsp; We have not yet had the Fiji Island 
novel.&nbsp; By the time he is through with it she must have a 
somewhat confused notion of herself&mdash;a vague conviction that
she is a sort of condensed South Kensington Museum.</p>
<h3>Difficulty of living up to the Poster.</h3>
<p>Poor Angelina must feel dissatisfied with the Edwin of real 
life.&nbsp; I am not sure that art and fiction have not made life
more difficult for us than even it was intended to be.&nbsp; The 
view from the mountain top is less extensive than represented by 
the picture postcard.&nbsp; The play, I fear me, does not always 
come up to the poster.&nbsp; Polly Perkins is pretty enough as 
girls go; but oh for the young lady of the grocer&rsquo;s 
almanack!&nbsp; Poor dear John is very nice and loves us&mdash;so
he tells us, in his stupid, halting way; but how can we respond 
when we remember how the man loved in the play!&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;artist has fashioned his dream of delight,&rdquo; and the 
workaday world by comparison seems tame to us.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>The Lady and the Problem.</h3>
<p>She is a good woman, the Heroine of the Problem Play, but 
accidents will happen, and other people were to blame.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is really the Problem: who was responsible for 
the heroine&rsquo;s past?&nbsp; Was it her father?&nbsp; She does
not say so&mdash;not in so many words.&nbsp; That is not her 
way.&nbsp; It is not for her, the silently-suffering victim of 
complicated antecedent incidents, to purchase justice for herself
by pointing the finger of accusation against him who, whatever 
his faults may be, was once, at all events, her father.&nbsp; 
That one fact in his favour she can never forget.&nbsp; Indeed 
she would not if she could.&nbsp; That one asset, for whatever it
may be worth by the time the Day of Judgment arrives, he shall 
retain.&nbsp; It shall not be taken from him.&nbsp; &ldquo;After 
all he was my father.&rdquo;&nbsp; She admits it, with the accent
on the &ldquo;was.&rdquo;&nbsp; That he is so no longer, he has 
only himself to blame.&nbsp; His subsequent behaviour has 
apparently rendered it necessary for her to sever the 
relationship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she has probably said to him, 
paraphrasing Othello&rsquo;s speech to Cassio; &ldquo;it is my 
duty, and&mdash;as by this time you must be aware&mdash;it is my 
keen if occasionally somewhat involved, sense of duty that is the
cause of almost all our troubles in this play.&nbsp; You will 
always remain the object of what I cannot help feeling is 
misplaced affection on my part, mingled with contempt.&nbsp; But 
never more be relative of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certain it is that but for her father she would never have had
a past.&nbsp; Failing anyone else on whom to lay the blame for 
whatever the lady may have done, we can generally fall back upon 
the father.&nbsp; He becomes our sheet-anchor, so to speak.&nbsp;
There are plays in which at first sight it would almost appear 
there was nobody to blame&mdash;nobody, except the heroine 
herself.&nbsp; It all seems to happen just because she is no 
better than she ought to be: clearly, the father&rsquo;s fault! 
for ever having had a daughter no better than she ought to 
be.&nbsp; As the Heroine of a certain Problem Play once put it 
neatly and succinctly to the old man himself: &ldquo;It is you 
parents that make us children what we are.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had 
him there.&nbsp; He had not a word to answer for himself, but 
went off centre, leaving his hat behind him.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, the father is merely a 
&ldquo;Scientist&rdquo;&mdash;which in Stageland is another term 
for helpless imbecile.&nbsp; In Stageland, if a gentleman has not
got to have much brain and you do not know what else to make of 
him, you let him be a scientist&mdash;and then, of course, he is 
only to blame in a minor degree.&nbsp; If he had not been a 
scientist&mdash;thinking more of his silly old stars or beetles 
than of his intricate daughter, he might have done 
something.&nbsp; The heroine does not say precisely what: perhaps
have taken her up stairs now and again, while she was still young
and susceptible of improvement, and have spanked some sense into 
her.</p>
<h3>The Stage Hero who, for once, had Justice done to him.</h3>
<p>I remember witnessing long ago, in a country barn, a highly 
moral play.&nbsp; It was a Problem Play, now I come to think of 
it.&nbsp; At least, that is, it would have been a Problem Play 
but that the party with the past happened in this case to be 
merely a male thing.&nbsp; Stage life presents no problems to the
man.&nbsp; The hero of the Problem Play has not got to wonder 
what to do; he has got to wonder only what the heroine will do 
next.&nbsp; The hero&mdash;he was not exactly the hero; he would 
have been the hero had he not been hanged in the last act.&nbsp; 
But for that he was rather a nice young man, full of sentiment 
and not ashamed of it.&nbsp; From the scaffold he pleaded for 
leave to embrace his mother just once more before he died.&nbsp; 
It was a pretty idea.&nbsp; The hangman himself was 
touched.&nbsp; The necessary leave was granted him.&nbsp; He 
descended the steps and flung his arms round the sobbing old 
lady, and&mdash;bit off her nose.&nbsp; After that he told her 
why he had bitten off her nose.&nbsp; It appeared that when he 
was a boy, he had returned home one evening with a rabbit in his 
pocket.&nbsp; Instead of putting him across her knee, and working
into him the eighth commandment, she had said nothing; but that 
it seemed to be a fairly useful sort of rabbit, and had sent him 
out into the garden to pick onions.&nbsp; If she had done her 
duty by him then, he would not have been now in his present most 
unsatisfactory position, and she would still have had her 
nose.&nbsp; The fathers and mothers in the audience applauded, 
but the children, scenting addition to precedent, looked 
glum.</p>
<p>Maybe it is something of this kind the heroine is hinting 
at.&nbsp; Perhaps the Problem has nothing to do with the heroine 
herself, but with the heroine&rsquo;s parents: what is the best 
way of bringing up a daughter who shows the slightest sign of 
developing a tendency towards a Past?&nbsp; Can it be done by 
kindness?&nbsp; And, if not, how much?</p>
<p>Occasionally the parents attempt to solve the Problem, so far 
as they are concerned, by dying young&mdash;shortly after the 
heroine&rsquo;s birth.&nbsp; No doubt they argue to themselves 
this is their only chance of avoiding future blame.&nbsp; But 
they do not get out of it so easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, if I had only had a mother&mdash;or even a 
father!&rdquo; cries the heroine: one feels how mean it was of 
them to slip away as they did.</p>
<p>The fact remains, however, that they are dead.&nbsp; One 
despises them for dying, but beyond that it is difficult to hold 
them personally responsible for the heroine&rsquo;s subsequent 
misdeeds.&nbsp; The argument takes to itself new shape.&nbsp; Is 
it Fate that is to blame?&nbsp; The lady herself would seem to 
favour this suggestion.&nbsp; It has always been her fate, she 
explains, to bring suffering and misery upon those she 
loves.&nbsp; At first, according to her own account, she rebelled
against this cruel Fate&mdash;possibly instigated thereto by the 
people unfortunate enough to be loved by her.&nbsp; But of late 
she has come to accept this strange destiny of hers with touching
resignation.&nbsp; It grieves her, when she thinks of it, that 
she is unable to imbue those she loves with her own patient 
spirit.&nbsp; They seem to be a fretful little band.</p>
<p>Considered as a scapegoat, Fate, as compared with the father, 
has this advantage: it is always about: it cannot slip away and 
die before the real trouble begins: it cannot even plead a 
scientific head; it is there all the time.&nbsp; With care one 
can blame it for most everything.&nbsp; The vexing thing about it
is, that it does not mind being blamed.&nbsp; One cannot make 
Fate feel small and mean.&nbsp; It affords no relief to our 
harrowed feelings to cry out indignantly to Fate: &ldquo;look 
here, what you have done.&nbsp; Look at this sweet and 
well-proportioned lady, compelled to travel first-class, 
accompanied by an amount of luggage that must be a perpetual 
nightmare to her maid, from one fashionable European resort to 
another; forced to exist on a well-secured income of, apparently,
five thousand a year, most of which has to go in clothes; beloved
by only the best people in the play; talked about by everybody 
incessantly to the exclusion of everybody else&mdash;all the 
neighbours interested in her and in nobody else much; all the 
women envying her; all the men tumbling over one another after 
her&mdash;looks, in spite of all her worries, not a day older 
than twenty-three; and has discovered a dressmaker never yet 
known to have been an hour behind her promise!&nbsp; And all your
fault, yours, Fate.&nbsp; Will nothing move you to 
shame?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>She has a way of mislaying her Husband.</h3>
<p>It brings no satisfaction with it, speaking out one&rsquo;s 
mind to Fate.&nbsp; We want to see him before us, the thing of 
flesh and blood that has brought all this upon her.&nbsp; Was it 
that early husband&mdash;or rather the gentleman she thought was 
her husband.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, he was a husband.&nbsp; 
Only he did not happen to be hers.&nbsp; That naturally confused 
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then who is my husband?&rdquo; she seems to 
have said to herself; &ldquo;I had a husband: I remember it 
distinctly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Difficult to know them apart from one another,&rdquo; 
says the lady with the past, &ldquo;the way they dress them all 
alike nowadays.&nbsp; I suppose it does not really matter.&nbsp; 
They are much the same as one another when you get them 
home.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t do to be too fussy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She is a careless woman.&nbsp; She is always mislaying that 
early husband.&nbsp; And she has an unfortunate knack of finding 
him at the wrong moment.&nbsp; Perhaps that is the Problem: What 
is a lady to do with a husband for whom she has no further 
use?&nbsp; If she gives him away he is sure to come back, like 
the clever dog that is sent in a hamper to the other end of the 
kingdom, and three days afterwards is found gasping on the 
doorstep.&nbsp; If she leaves him in the middle of South Africa, 
with most of the heavy baggage and all the debts, she may reckon 
it a certainty that on her return from her next honeymoon he will
be the first to greet her.</p>
<p>Her surprise at meeting him again is a little 
unreasonable.&nbsp; She seems to be under the impression that 
because she has forgotten him, he is for all practical purposes 
dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I forgot all about him,&rdquo; she seems to be 
arguing to herself, &ldquo;seven years ago at least.&nbsp; 
According to the laws of Nature there ought to be nothing left of
him but just his bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She is indignant at finding he is still alive, and lets him 
know it&mdash;tells him he is a beast for turning up at his 
sister&rsquo;s party, and pleads to him for one last favour: that
he will go away where neither she nor anybody else of any 
importance will ever see him or hear of him again.&nbsp; 
That&rsquo;s all she asks of him.&nbsp; If he make a point of it 
she will&mdash;though her costume is ill adapted to the 
exercise&mdash;go down upon her knees to ask it of him.</p>
<p>He brutally retorts that he doesn&rsquo;t know where to 
&ldquo;get.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lady travels round a good deal and 
seems to be in most places.&nbsp; She accepts week-end 
invitations to the houses of his nearest relatives.&nbsp; She has
married his first cousin, and is now getting up a bazaar with the
help of his present wife.&nbsp; How he is to avoid her he does 
not quite see.</p>
<p>Perhaps, by the by, that is really the Problem: where is the 
early husband to disappear to?&nbsp; Even if every time he saw 
her coming he were to duck under the table, somebody would be 
sure to notice it and make remarks.&nbsp; Ought he to take 
himself out one dark night, tie a brick round his neck, and throw
himself into a pond?</p>
<h3>What is a Lady to do with a Husband when she has finished 
with him?</h3>
<p>But men are so selfish.&nbsp; The idea does not even occur to 
him; and the lady herself is too generous to do more than just 
hint at it.</p>
<p>Maybe it is Society that is to blame.&nbsp; There comes a 
luminous moment when it is suddenly revealed to the Heroine of 
the Problem Play that it is Society that is at the bottom of this
thing.&nbsp; She has felt all along there was something the 
matter.&nbsp; Why has she never thought of it before?&nbsp; Here 
all these years has she been going about blaming her poor old 
father; her mother for dying too soon; the remarkable 
circumstances attending her girlhood; that dear old stupid 
husband she thought was hers; and all the while the really 
culpable party has been existing unsuspected under her very 
nose.&nbsp; She clears away the furniture a bit, and tells 
Society exactly what she thinks of it&mdash;she is always good at
that, telling people what she thinks of them.&nbsp; Other 
people&rsquo;s failings do not escape her, not for long.&nbsp; If
Society would only step out for a moment, and look at itself with
her eyes, something might be done.&nbsp; If Society, now that the
thing has been pointed out to it, has still any lingering desire 
to live, let it look at her.&nbsp; This, that she is, Society has
made her!&nbsp; Let Society have a walk round her, and then go 
home and reflect.</p>
<h3>Could she&mdash;herself&mdash;have been to blame?</h3>
<p>It lifts a load from us, fixing the blame on Society.&nbsp; 
There were periods in the play when we hardly knew what to 
think.&nbsp; The scientific father, the dead mother, the early 
husband! it was difficult to grasp the fact that they alone were 
to blame.&nbsp; One felt there was something to be said for even 
them.&nbsp; Ugly thoughts would cross our mind that perhaps the 
Heroine herself was not altogether irreproachable&mdash;that 
possibly there would have been less Problem, if, thinking a 
little less about her clothes, yearning a little less to do 
nothing all day long and be perfectly happy, she had pulled 
herself together, told herself that the world was not built 
exclusively for her, and settled down to the existence of an 
ordinary decent woman.</p>
<p>Looking at the thing all round, that is perhaps the best 
solution of the Problem: it is Society that is to blame.&nbsp; We
had better keep to that.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>Civilization and the Unemployed.</h3>
<p>Where Civilization fails is in not providing men and women 
with sufficient work.&nbsp; In the Stone Age man was, one 
imagines, kept busy.&nbsp; When he was not looking for his 
dinner, or eating his dinner, or sleeping off the effects of his 
dinner, he was hard at work with a club, clearing the 
neighbourhood of what one doubts not he would have described as 
aliens.&nbsp; The healthy Pal&aelig;olithic man would have had a 
contempt for Cobden rivalling that of Mr. Chamberlain 
himself.&nbsp; He did not take the incursion of the foreigner 
&ldquo;lying down.&rdquo;&nbsp; One pictures him in the 
mind&rsquo;s eye: unscientific, perhaps, but active to a degree 
difficult to conceive in these degenerate days.&nbsp; Now up a 
tree hurling cocoa-nuts, the next moment on the ground flinging 
roots and rocks.&nbsp; Both having tolerably hard heads, the 
argument would of necessity be long and heated.&nbsp; Phrases 
that have since come to be meaningless had, in those days, a real
significance.</p>
<p>When a Pal&aelig;olithic politician claimed to have 
&ldquo;crushed his critic,&rdquo; he meant that he had succeeded 
in dropping a tree or a ton of earth upon him.&nbsp; When it was 
said that one bright and intelligent member of that early 
sociology had &ldquo;annihilated his opponent,&rdquo; that 
opponent&rsquo;s friends and relations took no further interest 
in him.&nbsp; It meant that he was actually annihilated.&nbsp; 
Bits of him might be found, but the most of him would be 
hopelessly scattered.&nbsp; When the adherents of any particular 
Cave Dweller remarked that their man was wiping the floor with 
his rival, it did not mean that he was talking himself red in the
face to a bored audience of sixteen friends and a reporter.&nbsp;
It meant that he was dragging that rival by the legs round the 
enclosure and making the place damp and untidy with him.</p>
<h3>Early instances of &ldquo;Dumping.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Maybe the Cave Dweller, finding nuts in his own neighbourhood 
growing scarce, would emigrate himself: for even in that age the 
politician was not always logical.&nbsp; Thus <i>r&ocirc;les</i> 
became reversed.&nbsp; The defender of his country became the 
alien, dumping himself where he was not wanted.&nbsp; The charm 
of those early political arguments lay in their simplicity.&nbsp;
A child could have followed every point.&nbsp; There could never 
have been a moment&rsquo;s doubt, even among his own followers, 
as to what a Pal&aelig;olithic statesman really meant to 
convey.&nbsp; At the close of the contest the party who 
considered it had won the moral victory would be cleared away, or
buried neatly on the spot, according to taste: and the 
discussion, until the arrival of the next generation, was voted 
closed.</p>
<p>All this must have been harassing, but it did serve to pass 
away the time.&nbsp; Civilization has brought into being a 
section of the community with little else to do but to amuse 
itself.&nbsp; For youth to play is natural; the young barbarian 
plays, the kitten plays, the colt gambols, the lamb skips.&nbsp; 
But man is the only animal that gambols and jumps and skips after
it has reached maturity.&nbsp; Were we to meet an elderly bearded
goat, springing about in the air and behaving, generally 
speaking, like a kid, we should say it had gone mad.&nbsp; Yet we
throng in our thousands to watch elderly ladies and gentlemen 
jumping about after a ball, twisting themselves into strange 
shapes, rushing, racing, falling over one another; and present 
them with silver-backed hair-brushes and gold-handled umbrellas 
as a reward to them for doing so.</p>
<p>Imagine some scientific inhabitant of one of the larger fixed 
stars examining us through a magnifying-glass as we examine 
ants.&nbsp; Our amusements would puzzle him.&nbsp; The ball of 
all sorts and sizes, from the marble to the pushball, would lead 
to endless scientific argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; Why are these men and women always 
knocking it about, seizing it wherever and whenever they find it 
and worrying it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The observer from that fixed star would argue that the Ball 
must be some malignant creature of fiendish power, the great 
enemy of the human race.&nbsp; Watching our cricket-fields, our 
tennis-courts, our golf links, he would conclude that a certain 
section of mankind had been told off to do battle with the 
&ldquo;Ball&rdquo; on behalf of mankind in general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a rule,&rdquo; so he would report, &ldquo;it is a 
superior class of insect to which this special duty has been 
assigned.&nbsp; They are a friskier, gaudier species than their 
fellows.</p>
<h3>Cricket, as viewed from the fixed Stars.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;For this one purpose they appear to be kept and 
fed.&nbsp; They do no other work, so far as I have been able to 
ascertain.&nbsp; Carefully selected and trained, their mission is
to go about the world looking for Balls.&nbsp; Whenever they find
a Ball they set to work to kill it.&nbsp; But the vitality of 
these Balls is extraordinary.&nbsp; There is a medium-sized, 
reddish species that, on an average, takes three days to 
kill.&nbsp; When one of these is discovered, specially trained 
champions are summoned from every corner of the country.&nbsp; 
They arrive in hot haste, eager for the battle, which takes place
in the presence of the entire neighbourhood.&nbsp; The number of 
champions for some reason or another is limited to 
twenty-two.&nbsp; Each one seizing in turn a large piece of wood,
rushes at the Ball as it flies along the ground, or through the 
air, and strikes at it with all his force.&nbsp; When, exhausted,
he can strike no longer, he throws down his weapon and retires 
into a tent, where he is restored to strength by copious draughts
of a drug the nature of which I have been unable to 
discover.&nbsp; Meanwhile, another has picked up the fallen 
weapon, and the contest is continued without a moment&rsquo;s 
interruption.&nbsp; The Ball makes frantic efforts to escape from
its tormentors, but every time it is captured and flung 
back.&nbsp; So far as can be observed, it makes no attempt at 
retaliation, its only object being to get away; though, 
occasionally&mdash;whether by design or accident&mdash;it 
succeeds in inflicting injury upon one or other of its 
executioners, or more often upon one of the spectators, striking 
him either on the head or about the region of the waist, which, 
judging by results, would appear, from the Ball&rsquo;s point of 
view, to be the better selection.&nbsp; These small reddish Balls
are quickened into life evidently by the heat of the sun; in the 
cold season they disappear, and their place is taken by a much 
larger Ball.&nbsp; This Ball the champions kill by striking it 
with their feet and with their heads.&nbsp; But sometimes they 
will attempt to suffocate it by falling on it, some dozen of them
at a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another of these seemingly harmless enemies of the 
human race is a small white Ball of great cunning and 
resource.&nbsp; It frequents sandy districts by the sea coast and
open spaces near the large towns.&nbsp; It is pursued with 
extraordinary animosity by a florid-faced insect of fierce aspect
and rotundity of figure.&nbsp; The weapon he employs is a long 
stick loaded with metal.&nbsp; With one blow he will send the 
creature through the air sometimes to a distance of nearly a 
quarter of a mile; yet so vigorous is the constitution of these 
Balls that it will fall to earth apparently but little 
damaged.&nbsp; It is followed by the rotund man accompanied by a 
smaller insect carrying spare clubs.&nbsp; Though hampered by the
prominent whiteness of its skin, the extreme smallness of this 
Ball often enables it to defy re-discovery, and at such times the
fury of the little round man is terrible to contemplate.&nbsp; He
dances round the spot where the ball has disappeared, making 
frenzied passes at the surrounding vegetation with his club, 
uttering the while the most savage and bloodcurdling 
growls.&nbsp; Occasionally striking at the small creature in 
fury, he will miss it altogether, and, having struck merely the 
air, will sit down heavily upon the ground, or, striking the 
solid earth, will shatter his own club.&nbsp; Then a curious 
thing takes place: all the other insects standing round place 
their right hand before their mouth, and, turning away their 
faces, shake their bodies to and fro, emitting a strange 
crackling sound.&nbsp; Whether this is to be regarded as a mere 
expression of their grief that the blow of their comrade should 
have miscarried, or whether one may assume it to be a ceremonious
appeal to their gods for better luck next time, I have not as yet
made up my mind.&nbsp; The striker, meanwhile, raises both arms, 
the hands tightly clenched, towards the heavens, and utters what 
is probably a prayer, prepared expressly for the 
occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Heir of all Ages.&nbsp; His Inheritance.</h3>
<p>In similar manner he, the Celestial Observer, proceeds to 
describe our billiard matches, our tennis tournaments, our 
croquet parties.&nbsp; Maybe it never occurs to him that a large 
section of our race surrounded by Eternity, would devote its 
entire span of life to sheer killing of time.&nbsp; A middle-aged
friend of mine, a cultured gentleman, a M.A. of Cambridge, 
assured me the other day that, notwithstanding all his 
experiences of life, the thing that still gave him the greatest 
satisfaction was the accomplishment of a successful drive to 
leg.&nbsp; Rather a quaint commentary on our civilization, is it 
not?&nbsp; &ldquo;The singers have sung, and the builders have 
builded.&nbsp; The artists have fashioned their dreams of 
delight.&rdquo;&nbsp; The martyrs for thought and freedom have 
died their death; knowledge has sprung from the bones of 
ignorance; civilization for ten thousand years has battled with 
brutality to this result&mdash;that a specimen gentleman of the 
Twentieth Century, the heir of all the ages, finds his greatest 
joy in life the striking of a ball with a chunk of wood!</p>
<p>Human energy, human suffering, has been wasted.&nbsp; Such 
crown of happiness for a man might surely have been obtained 
earlier and at less cost.&nbsp; Was it intended?&nbsp; Are we on 
the right track?&nbsp; The child&rsquo;s play is wiser.&nbsp; The
battered doll is a princess.&nbsp; Within the sand castle dwells 
an ogre.&nbsp; It is with imagination that he plays.&nbsp; His 
games have some relation to life.&nbsp; It is the man only who is
content with this everlasting knocking about of a ball.&nbsp; The
majority of mankind is doomed to labour so constant, so 
exhausting, that no opportunity is given it to cultivate its 
brain.&nbsp; Civilization has arranged that a small privileged 
minority shall alone enjoy that leisure necessary to the 
development of thought.&nbsp; And what is the answer of this 
leisured class?&nbsp; It is:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will do nothing for the world that feeds us, clothes
us, keeps us in luxury.&nbsp; We will spend our whole existence 
knocking balls about, watching other people knocking balls about,
arguing with one another as to the best means of knocking balls 
about.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Is it &ldquo;Playing the Game?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Is it&mdash;to use their own jargon&mdash;&ldquo;playing the 
game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the queer thing is this over-worked world, that stints 
itself to keep them in idleness, approves of the answer.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The flannelled fool,&rdquo; &ldquo;The muddied oaf,&rdquo;
is the pet of the people; their hero, their ideal.</p>
<p>But maybe all this is mere jealousy.&nbsp; Myself, I have 
never been clever at knocking balls about.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>Patience and the Waiter.</h3>
<p>The slowest waiter I know is the British railway 
refreshment-room waiter.</p>
<p>His very breathing&mdash;regular, harmonious, penetrating, 
instinct as it is with all the better attributes of a 
well-preserved grandfather&rsquo;s clock&mdash;conveys suggestion
of dignity and peace.&nbsp; He is a huge, impressive 
person.&nbsp; There emanates from him an atmosphere of 
Lotusland.&nbsp; The otherwise unattractive refreshment-room 
becomes an oasis of repose amid the turmoil of a fretful 
world.&nbsp; All things conspire to aid him: the ancient joints, 
ranged side by side like corpses in a morgue, each one decently 
hidden under its white muslin shroud, whispering of death and 
decay; the dish of dead flies, thoughtfully placed in the centre 
of the table; the framed advertisements extolling the virtues of 
heavy beers and stouts, of weird champagnes, emanating from 
haunted-looking ch&acirc;teaux, situate&mdash;if one may judge 
from the illustration&mdash;in the midst of desert lands; the 
sleep-inviting buzz of the bluebottles.</p>
<p>The spirit of the place steals over you.&nbsp; On entering, 
with a quarter of an hour to spare, your idea was a cutlet and a 
glass of claret.&nbsp; In the face of the refreshment-room 
waiter, the notion appears frivolous, not to say 
un-English.&nbsp; You order cold beef and pickles, with a pint of
bitter in a tankard.&nbsp; To win the British waiter&rsquo;s 
approval, you must always order beer in a tankard.&nbsp; The 
British waiter, in his ideals, is medi&aelig;val.&nbsp; There is 
a Shakespearean touch about a tankard.&nbsp; A soapy potato will,
of course, be added.&nbsp; Afterwards a ton of cheese and a basin
of rabbit&rsquo;s food floating in water (the British salad) will
be placed before you.&nbsp; You will work steadily through the 
whole, anticipating the somnolence that will subsequently fall 
upon you with a certain amount of satisfaction.&nbsp; It will 
serve to dispel the last lingering regret at the reflection that 
you will miss your appointment, and suffer thereby serious 
inconvenience if not positive loss.&nbsp; These things are of the
world&mdash;the noisy, tiresome world you have left without.</p>
<p>To the English traveller, the foreign waiter in the earlier 
stages of his career is a burden and a trial.&nbsp; When he is 
complete&mdash;when he really can talk English I rejoice in 
him.&nbsp; When I object to him is when his English is worse than
my French or German, and when he will, for his own educational 
purposes, insist, nevertheless, that the conversation shall be 
entirely in English.&nbsp; I would he came to me some other 
time.&nbsp; I would so much rather make it after dinner or, say, 
the next morning.&nbsp; I hate giving lessons during meal 
times.</p>
<p>Besides, to a man with feeble digestion, this sort of thing 
can lead to trouble.&nbsp; One waiter I met at an hotel in Dijon 
knew very little English&mdash;about as much as a poll 
parrot.&nbsp; The moment I entered the 
<i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i> he started to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; You English!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what about us?&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; It was 
during the period of the Boer War.&nbsp; I took it he was about 
to denounce the English nation generally.&nbsp; I was looking for
something to throw at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You English&mdash;you Englishman, yes,&rdquo; he 
repeated.</p>
<p>And then I understood he had merely intended a question.&nbsp;
I owned up that I was, and accused him in turn of being a 
Frenchman.&nbsp; He admitted it.&nbsp; Introductions, as it were,
thus over, I thought I would order dinner.&nbsp; I ordered it in 
French.&nbsp; I am not bragging of my French, I never wanted to 
learn French.&nbsp; Even as a boy, it was more the idea of others
than of myself.&nbsp; I learnt as little as possible.&nbsp; But I
have learnt enough to live in places where they can&rsquo;t, or 
won&rsquo;t, speak anything else.&nbsp; Left to myself, I could 
have enjoyed a very satisfactory dinner.&nbsp; I was tired with a
long day&rsquo;s journey, and hungry.&nbsp; They cook well at 
this hotel.&nbsp; I had been looking forward to my dinner for 
hours and hours.&nbsp; I had sat down in my imagination to a 
<i>consomm&eacute; bisque</i>, <i>s&ocirc;le au gratin</i>, a 
<i>poulet saut&eacute;</i>, and an <i>omelette au 
fromage</i>.</p>
<h3>Waiterkind in the making.</h3>
<p>It is wrong to let one&rsquo;s mind dwell upon carnal 
delights; I see that now.&nbsp; At the time I was mad about 
it.&nbsp; The fool would not even listen to me.&nbsp; He had got 
it into his garlic-sodden brain that all Englishmen live on beef,
and nothing but beef.&nbsp; He swept aside all my suggestions as 
though they had been the prattlings of a foolish child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haf nice biftek.&nbsp; Not at all done.&nbsp; 
Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
don&rsquo;t want what the cook of a French provincial hotel calls
a biftek.&nbsp; I want something to eat.&nbsp; I 
want&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Apparently, he understood neither 
English nor French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he interrupted cheerfully, &ldquo;with
pottitoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; I thought for the 
moment he was suggesting potted pigs&rsquo; feet in the nearest 
English he could get to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pottito,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;boil pottito.&nbsp;
Yes?&nbsp; And pell hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt like telling him to go there; I suppose he meant 
&ldquo;pale ale.&rdquo;&nbsp; It took me about five minutes to 
get that beefsteak out of his head.&nbsp; By the time I had done 
it, I did not care what I had for dinner.&nbsp; I took 
<i>p&ocirc;t-du-jour</i> and veal.&nbsp; He added, on his own 
initiative, a thing that looked like a poultice.&nbsp; I did not 
try the taste of it.&nbsp; He explained it was &ldquo;plum 
poodeen.&rdquo;&nbsp; I fancy he had made it himself.</p>
<p>This fellow is typical; you meet him everywhere abroad.&nbsp; 
He translates your bill into English for you, calls ten centimes 
a penny, calculates twelve francs to the pound, and presses a 
handful of sous affectionately upon you as change for a 
napoleon.</p>
<p>The cheating waiter is common to all countries, though in 
Italy and Belgium he flourishes, perhaps, more than 
elsewhere.&nbsp; But the British waiter, when detected, becomes 
surly&mdash;does not take it nicely.&nbsp; The foreign waiter is 
amiable about it&mdash;bears no malice.&nbsp; He is grieved, 
maybe, at your language, but that is because he is thinking of 
you&mdash;the possible effect of it upon your future.&nbsp; To 
try and stop you, he offers you another four sous.&nbsp; The 
story is told of a Frenchman who, not knowing the legal fare, 
adopted the plan of doling out pennies to a London cabman one at 
a time, continuing until the man looked satisfied.&nbsp; Myself, 
I doubt the story.&nbsp; From what I know of the London cabman, I
can see him leaning down still, with out-stretched hand, the 
horse between the shafts long since dead, the cab chockfull of 
coppers, and yet no expression of satiety upon his face.</p>
<p>But the story would appear to have crossed the Channel, and to
have commended itself to the foreign waiter&mdash;especially to 
the railway refreshment-room waiter.&nbsp; He doles out sous to 
the traveller, one at a time, with the air of a man who is giving
away the savings of a lifetime.&nbsp; If, after five minutes or 
so, you still appear discontented he goes away quite 
suddenly.&nbsp; You think he has gone to open another chest of 
half-pence, but when a quarter of an hour has passed and he does 
not reappear, you inquire about him amongst the other 
waiters.</p>
<p>A gloom at once falls upon them.&nbsp; You have spoken of the 
very thing that has been troubling them.&nbsp; He used to be a 
waiter here once&mdash;one might almost say until quite 
recently.&nbsp; As to what has become of him&mdash;ah! there you 
have them.&nbsp; If in the course of their chequered career they 
ever come across him, they will mention to him that you are 
waiting for him.&nbsp; Meanwhile a stentorian-voiced official is 
shouting that your train is on the point of leaving.&nbsp; You 
console yourself with the reflection that it might have been 
more.&nbsp; It always might have been more; sometimes it is.</p>
<h3>His Little Mistakes.</h3>
<p>A waiter at the Gare du Nord, in Brussels, on one occasion 
pressed upon me a five-franc piece, a small Turkish coin the 
value of which was unknown to me, and remains so to this day, a 
distinctly bad two francs, and from a quarter of a pound to six 
ounces of centimes, as change for a twenty-franc note, after 
deducting the price of a cup of coffee.&nbsp; He put it down with
the air of one subscribing to a charity.&nbsp; We looked at one 
another.&nbsp; I suppose I must have conveyed to him the 
impression of being discontented.&nbsp; He drew a purse from his 
pocket.&nbsp; The action suggested that, for the purpose of 
satisfying my inordinate demands, he would be compelled to draw 
upon his private resources; but it did not move me.&nbsp; 
Abstracting reluctantly a fifty-centime piece, he added it to the
heap upon the table.</p>
<p>I suggested his taking a seat, as at this rate it seemed 
likely we should be doing business together for some time.&nbsp; 
I think he gathered I was not a fool.&nbsp; Hitherto he had been 
judging, I suppose, purely from appearances.&nbsp; But he was not
in the least offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, with a cheery laugh, 
&ldquo;Monsieur comprend!&rdquo;&nbsp; He swept the whole 
nonsense back into his bag and gave me the right change.&nbsp; I 
slipped my arm through his and insisted upon the pleasure of his 
society, until I had examined each and every coin.&nbsp; He went 
away chuckling, and told another waiter all about it.&nbsp; They 
both of them bowed to me as I went out, and wished me a pleasant 
journey.&nbsp; I left them still chuckling.&nbsp; A British 
waiter would have been sulky all the afternoon.</p>
<p>The waiter who insists upon mistaking you for the heir of all 
the Rothschilds used to cost me dear when I was younger.&nbsp; I 
find the best plan is to take him in hand at the beginning and 
disillusion him; sweep aside his talk of &rsquo;84 Perrier Jouet,
followed by a &rsquo;79 Ch&acirc;teau Lafite, and ask him, as man
to man, if he can conscientiously recommend the Saint Julien at 
two-and-six.&nbsp; After that he settles down to his work and 
talks sense.</p>
<p>The fatherly waiter is sometimes a comfort.&nbsp; You feel 
that he knows best.&nbsp; Your instinct is to address him as 
&ldquo;Uncle.&rdquo;&nbsp; But you remember yourself in 
time.&nbsp; When you are dining a lady, however, and wish to 
appear important, he is apt to be in the way.&nbsp; It seems, 
somehow, to be his dinner.&nbsp; You have a sense almost of being
<i>de trop</i>.</p>
<p>The greatest insult you can offer a waiter is to mistake him 
for your waiter.&nbsp; You think he is your waiter&mdash;there is
the bald head, the black side-whiskers, the Roman nose.&nbsp; But
your waiter had blue eyes, this man soft hazel.&nbsp; You had 
forgotten to notice the eyes.&nbsp; You bar his progress and ask 
him for the red pepper.&nbsp; The haughty contempt with which he 
regards you is painful to bear.&nbsp; It is as if you had 
insulted a lady.&nbsp; He appears to be saying the same 
thing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you have made a mistake.&nbsp; You are possibly
confusing me with somebody else; I have not the honour of your 
acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>How to insult him.</h3>
<p>I do not wish it to be understood that I am in the habit of 
insulting ladies, but occasionally I have made an innocent 
mistake, and have met with some such response.&nbsp; The wrong 
waiter conveys to me precisely the same feeling of 
humiliation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send your waiter to you,&rdquo; he 
answers.&nbsp; His tone implies that there are waiters and 
waiters; some may not mind what class of person they serve: 
others, though poor, have their self-respect.&nbsp; It is clear 
to you now why your waiter is keeping away from you; the man is 
ashamed of being your waiter.&nbsp; He is watching, probably, for
an opportunity to approach you when nobody is looking.&nbsp; The 
other waiter finds him for you.&nbsp; He was hiding behind a 
screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Table forty-two wants you,&rdquo; the other tells 
him.&nbsp; The tone of voice adds:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like to encourage this class of customer that is
your business; but don&rsquo;t ask me to have anything to do with
him.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>The everlasting Newness of Woman.</h3>
<p>An Oriental visitor was returning from our shores to his 
native land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked the youthful diplomatist who had 
been told off to show him round, as on the deck of the steamer 
they shook hands, &ldquo;what do you now think of 
England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much woman,&rdquo; answered the grave Orientalist, 
and descended to his cabin.</p>
<p>The young diplomatist returned to the shore thoughtful, and 
later in the day a few of us discussed the matter in a far-off, 
dimly-lighted corner of the club smoking-room.</p>
<p>Has the pendulum swung too far the other way?&nbsp; Could 
there be truth in our Oriental friend&rsquo;s terse 
commentary?&nbsp; The eternal feminine!&nbsp; The Western world 
has been handed over to her.&nbsp; The stranger from Mars or 
Jupiter would describe us as a hive of women, the sober-clad male
being retained apparently on condition of its doing all the hard 
work and making itself generally useful.&nbsp; Formerly it was 
the man who wore the fine clothes who went to the shows.&nbsp; 
To-day it is the woman gorgeously clad for whom the shows are 
organized.&nbsp; The man dressed in a serviceable and 
unostentatious, not to say depressing, suit of black accompanies 
her for the purpose of carrying her cloak and calling her 
carriage.&nbsp; Among the working classes life, of necessity, 
remains primitive; the law of the cave is still, with slight 
modification, the law of the slum.&nbsp; But in upper and 
middle-class circles the man is now the woman&rsquo;s 
servant.</p>
<p>I remember being present while a mother of my acquaintance was
instilling into the mind of her little son the advantages of 
being born a man.&nbsp; A little girl cousin was about to spend a
week with him.&nbsp; It was impressed upon him that if she showed
a liking for any of his toys, he was at once to give them up to 
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why, mamma?&rdquo; he demanded, evidently 
surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, my dear, you are a little man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Should she break them, he was not to smack her head or kick 
her&mdash;as his instinct might prompt him to do.&nbsp; He was 
just to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is of no consequence at all,&rdquo; and to look 
as if he meant it.</p>
<h3>Doctor says she is not to be bothered.</h3>
<p>She was always to choose the game&mdash;to have the biggest 
apple.&nbsp; There was much more of a similar nature.&nbsp; It 
was all because he was a little man and she was a little 
woman.&nbsp; At the end he looked up, puzzled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t she do anything, &rsquo;cos she&rsquo;s
a little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was explained to him that she didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; By right 
of being born a little girl she was exempt from all duty.</p>
<p>Woman nowadays is not taking any duty.&nbsp; She objects to 
housekeeping; she calls it domestic slavery, and feels she was 
intended for higher things.&nbsp; What higher things she does not
condescend to explain.&nbsp; One or two wives of my acquaintance 
have persuaded their husbands that these higher things are 
all-important.&nbsp; The home has been given up.&nbsp; In company
with other strivers after higher things, they live now in dismal 
barracks differing but little from a glorified Bloomsbury 
lodging-house.&nbsp; But they call them &ldquo;Mansions&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Courts,&rdquo; and seem proud of the address.&nbsp; They 
are not bothered with servants&mdash;with housekeeping.&nbsp; The
idea of the modern woman is that she is not to be bothered with 
anything.&nbsp; I remember the words with which one of these 
ladies announced her departure from her bothering home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I&rsquo;m tired of trouble,&rdquo; she 
confided to another lady, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ve made up my mind 
not to have any more of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Artemus Ward tells us of a man who had been in prison for 
twenty years.&nbsp; Suddenly a bright idea occurred to him; he 
opened the window and got out.&nbsp; Here have we poor, foolish 
mortals been imprisoned in this troublesome world for Lord knows 
how many millions of years.&nbsp; We have got so used to trouble 
we thought there was no help for it.&nbsp; We have told ourselves
that &ldquo;Man is born to trouble as the sparks fly 
upwards.&rdquo;&nbsp; We imagined the only thing to be done was 
to bear it philosophically.&nbsp; Why did not this bright young 
creature come along before&mdash;show us the way out.&nbsp; All 
we had to do was to give up the bothering home and the bothering 
servants, and go into a &ldquo;Mansion&rdquo; or a 
&ldquo;Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems that you leave trouble outside&mdash;in charge of the
hall-porter, one supposes.&nbsp; He ties it up for you as the 
Commissionaire of the Army and Navy Stores ties up your 
dog.&nbsp; If you want it again, you ask for it as you come 
out.&nbsp; Small wonder that the &ldquo;Court&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Mansion&rdquo; are growing in popularity every day.</p>
<h3>That &ldquo;Higher Life.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>They have nothing to do now all day long, these soaring wives 
of whom I am speaking.&nbsp; They would scorn to sew on a 
shirt-button even.&nbsp; Are there not other women&mdash;of an 
inferior breed&mdash;specially fashioned by Providence for the 
doing of such slavish tasks?&nbsp; They have no more bothers of 
any kind.&nbsp; They are free to lead the higher life.&nbsp; What
I am waiting for is a glimpse of the higher life.&nbsp; One of 
them, it is true, has taken up the violin.&nbsp; Another of them 
is devoting her emancipation to poker work.&nbsp; A third is 
learning skirt-dancing.&nbsp; Are these the &ldquo;higher 
things&rdquo; for which women are claiming freedom from all 
duty?&nbsp; And, if so, is there not danger that the closing of 
our homes may lead to the crowding up of the world with too much 
higher things?</p>
<p>May there not, by the time all bothers have been removed from 
woman&rsquo;s path, be too many amateur violinists in the world, 
too many skirt-dancers, too much poker work?&nbsp; If not, what 
are they? these &ldquo;higher things,&rdquo; for which so many 
women are demanding twenty-four hours a day leisure.&nbsp; I want
to know.</p>
<p>One lady of my acquaintance is a Poor Law Guardian and 
secretary to a labour bureau.&nbsp; But then she runs a house 
with two servants, four children, and a husband, and appears to 
be so used to bothers that she would feel herself lost without 
them.&nbsp; You can do this kind of work apparently even when you
are bothered with a home.&nbsp; It is the skirt-dancing and the 
poker work that cannot brook rivalry.&nbsp; The modern woman has 
begun to find children a nuisance; they interfere with her 
development.&nbsp; The mere man, who has written his poems, 
painted his pictures, composed his melodies, fashioned his 
philosophies, in the midst of life&rsquo;s troubles and bothers, 
grows nervous thinking what this new woman must be whose mind is 
so tremendous that the whole world must be shut up, so to speak, 
sent to do its business out of her sight and hearing, lest her 
attention should be distracted.</p>
<p>An optimistic friend of mine tells me not to worry myself; 
tells me that it is going to come out all right in the end.&nbsp;
Woman just now, he contends, is passing through her college 
period.&nbsp; The school life of strict surveillance is for ever 
done with.&nbsp; She is now the young Freshwoman.&nbsp; The 
bothering lessons are over, the bothering schoolmaster she has 
said good-bye to.&nbsp; She has her latchkey and is &ldquo;on her
own.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are still some bothering rules about 
being in at twelve o&rsquo;clock, and so many attendances each 
term at chapel.&nbsp; She is indignant.&nbsp; This interferes 
with her idea that life is to be one long orgie of 
self-indulgence, of pleasure.&nbsp; The college period will 
pass&mdash;is passing.&nbsp; Woman will go out into the world, 
take her place there, discover that bothers were not left behind 
in the old schoolhouse, will learn that life has duties, 
responsibilities, will take up her burden side by side with man, 
will accomplish her destiny.</p>
<h3>Is there anything left for her to learn?</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, however, she is having a good time&mdash;some 
people think too good a time.&nbsp; She wants the best of 
both.&nbsp; She demands the joys of independence together with 
freedom from all work&mdash;slavery she calls it.&nbsp; The 
servants are not to be allowed to bother her, the children are 
not to be allowed to bother her, her husband is not to be allowed
to bother her.&nbsp; She is to be free to lead the higher 
life.&nbsp; My dear lady, we all want to lead the higher 
life.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to write these articles.&nbsp; I 
want somebody else to bother about my rates and taxes, my 
children&rsquo;s boots, while I sit in an easy-chair and dream 
about the wonderful books I am going to write, if only a stupid 
public would let me.&nbsp; Tommy Smith of Brixton feels that he 
was intended for higher things.&nbsp; He does not want to be 
wasting his time in an office from nine to six adding up 
figures.&nbsp; His proper place in life is that of Prime Minister
or Field Marshal: he feels it.&nbsp; Do you think the man has no 
yearning for higher things?&nbsp; Do you think we like the 
office, the shop, the factory?&nbsp; We ought to be writing 
poetry, painting pictures, the whole world admiring us.&nbsp; You
seem to imagine your man goes off every morning to a sort of City
picnic, has eight hours&rsquo; fun&mdash;which he calls 
work&mdash;and then comes home to annoy you with chatter about 
dinner.</p>
<p>It is the old fable reversed; man said woman had nothing to do
all day but to enjoy herself.&nbsp; Making a potato pie!&nbsp; 
What sort of work was that?&nbsp; Making a potato pie was a lark;
anybody could make a potato pie.</p>
<p>So the woman said, &ldquo;Try it,&rdquo; and took the 
man&rsquo;s spade and went out into the field, and left him at 
home to make that pie.</p>
<p>The man discovered that potato pies took a bit more making 
than he had reckoned&mdash;found that running the house and 
looking after the children was not quite the merry pastime he had
argued.&nbsp; Man was a fool.</p>
<p>Now it is the woman who talks without thinking.&nbsp; How did 
she like hoeing the potato patch?&nbsp; Hard work, was it not, my
dear lady?&nbsp; Made your back ache?&nbsp; It came on to rain 
and you got wet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see that it very much matters which of you hoes 
the potato patch, which of you makes the potato pie.&nbsp; Maybe 
the hoeing of the patch demands more muscle&mdash;is more suited 
to the man.&nbsp; Maybe the making of the pie may be more in your
department.&nbsp; But, as I have said, I cannot see that this 
matter is of importance.&nbsp; The patch has to be hoed, the pie 
to be cooked; the one cannot do the both.&nbsp; Settle it between
you, and, having settled it, agree to do each your own work free 
from this everlasting nagging.</p>
<p>I know, personally, three ladies who have exchanged the 
woman&rsquo;s work for the man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; One was deserted by
her husband, and left with two young children.&nbsp; She hired a 
capable woman to look after the house, and joined a ladies&rsquo;
orchestra as pianist at two pounds a week.&nbsp; She now earns 
four, and works twelve hours a day.&nbsp; The husband of the 
second fell ill.&nbsp; She set him to write letters and run 
errands, which was light work that he could do, and started a 
dressmaker&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; The third was left a widow 
without means.&nbsp; She sent her three children to 
boarding-school, and opened a tea-room.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know 
how they talked before, but I know that they do not talk now as 
though earning the income was a sort of round game.</p>
<h3>When they have tried it the other way round.</h3>
<p>On the Continent they have gone deliberately to work, one 
would imagine, to reverse matters.&nbsp; Abroad woman is always 
where man ought to be, and man where most ladies would prefer to 
meet with women.&nbsp; The ladies <i>garde-robe</i> is 
superintended by a superannuated sergeant of artillery.&nbsp; 
When I want to curl my moustache, say, I have to make application
to a superb golden-haired creature, who stands by and watches me 
with an interested smile.&nbsp; I would be much happier waited on
by the superannuated sergeant, and my wife tells me she could 
very well spare him.&nbsp; But it is the law of the land.&nbsp; I
remember the first time I travelled with my daughter on the 
Continent.&nbsp; In the morning I was awakened by a piercing 
scream from her room.&nbsp; I struggled into my pyjamas, and 
rushed to her assistance.&nbsp; I could not see her.&nbsp; I 
could see nothing but a muscular-looking man in a blue blouse 
with a can of hot water in one hand and a pair of boots in the 
other.&nbsp; He appeared to be equally bewildered with myself at 
the sight of the empty bed.&nbsp; From a cupboard in the corner 
came a wail of distress:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do send that horrid man away.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s he
doing in my room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I explained to her afterwards that the chambermaid abroad is 
always an active and willing young man.&nbsp; The foreign girl 
fills in her time bricklaying and grooming down the horses.&nbsp;
It is a young and charming lady who serves you when you enter the
tobacconist&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t understand tobacco, 
is unsympathetic; with Mr. Frederic Harrison, regards smoking as 
a degrading and unclean habit; cannot see, herself, any 
difference between shag and Mayblossom, seeing that they are both
the same price; thinks you fussy.&nbsp; The corset shop is run by
a most presentable young man in a Vandyck beard.&nbsp; The wife 
runs the restaurant; the man does the cooking, and yet the woman 
has not reached freedom from bother.</p>
<h3>A brutal suggestion.</h3>
<p>It sounds brutal, but perhaps woman was not intended to live 
free from all bothers.&nbsp; Perhaps even the higher 
life&mdash;the skirt-dancing and the poker work&mdash;has its 
bothers.&nbsp; Perhaps woman was intended to take her share of 
the world&rsquo;s work&mdash;of the world&rsquo;s bothers.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>Why I hate Heroes.</h3>
<p>When I was younger, reading the popular novel used to make me 
sad.&nbsp; I find it vexes others also.&nbsp; I was talking to a 
bright young girl upon the subject not so very long ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just hate the girl in the novel,&rdquo; she 
confessed.&nbsp; &ldquo;She makes me feel real bad.&nbsp; If I 
don&rsquo;t think of her I feel pleased with myself, and good; 
but when I read about her&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m crazy.&nbsp; I 
would not mind her being smart, sometimes.&nbsp; We can all of us
say the right thing, now and then.&nbsp; This girl says them 
straight away, all the time.&nbsp; She don&rsquo;t have to dig 
for them even; they come crowding out of her.&nbsp; There never 
happens a time when she stands there feeling like a fool and 
knowing that she looks it.&nbsp; As for her hair: &rsquo;pon my 
word, there are days when I believe it is a wig.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d 
like to get behind her and give it just one pull.&nbsp; It curls 
of its own accord.&nbsp; She don&rsquo;t seem to have any trouble
with it.&nbsp; Look at this mop of mine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been 
working at it for three-quarters of an hour this morning; and now
I would not laugh, not if you were to tell me the funniest thing,
you&rsquo;d ever heard, for fear it would come down again.&nbsp; 
As for her clothes, they make me tired.&nbsp; She don&rsquo;t 
possess a frock that does not fit her to perfection; she 
doesn&rsquo;t have to think about them.&nbsp; You would imagine 
she went into the garden and picked them off a tree.&nbsp; She 
just slips it on and comes down, and then&mdash;my stars!&nbsp; 
All the other women in the room may just as well go to bed and 
get a good night&rsquo;s rest for all the chance they&rsquo;ve 
got.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t that she&rsquo;s beautiful.&nbsp; From 
what they tell you about her, you might fancy her a freak.&nbsp; 
Looks don&rsquo;t appear to matter to her; she gets there 
anyhow.&nbsp; I tell you she just makes me boil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allowing for the difference between the masculine and feminine
outlook, this is precisely how I used to feel when reading of the
hero.&nbsp; He was not always good; sometimes he hit the villain 
harder than he had intended, and then he was sorry&mdash;when it 
was too late, blamed himself severely, and subscribed towards the
wreath.&nbsp; Like the rest of us, he made mistakes; occasionally
married the wrong girl.&nbsp; But how well he did 
everything!&mdash;does still for the matter of that, I 
believe.&nbsp; Take it that he condescends to play cricket!&nbsp;
He never scores less than a hundred&mdash;does not know how to 
score less than a hundred, wonders how it could be done, 
supposing, for example, you had an appointment and wanted to 
catch an early train.&nbsp; I used to play cricket myself, but I 
could always stop at ten or twenty.&nbsp; There have been times 
when I have stopped at even less.</p>
<p>It is the same with everything he puts his hand to.&nbsp; 
Either he does not care for boating at all, or, as a matter of 
course, he pulls stroke in the University Boat-race; and then 
takes the train on to Henley and wins the Diamond Sculls so 
easily that it hardly seems worth while for the other fellow to 
have started.&nbsp; Were I living in Novel-land, and had I 
entered for the Diamond Sculls, I should put it to my opponent 
before the word was given to us to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One minute!&rdquo; I should have called out to 
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you the hero of this novel, or, like 
myself, only one of the minor characters?&nbsp; Because, if you 
are the hero you go on; don&rsquo;t you wait for me.&nbsp; I 
shall just pull as far as the boathouse and get myself a cup of 
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Because it always seems to be his Day.</h3>
<p>There is no sense of happy medium about the hero of the 
popular novel.&nbsp; He cannot get astride a horse without its 
going off and winning a steeplechase against the favourite.&nbsp;
The crowd in Novel-land appears to have no power of 
observation.&nbsp; It worries itself about the odds, discusses 
records, reads the nonsense published by the sporting 
papers.&nbsp; Were I to find myself on a racecourse in Novel-land
I should not trouble about the unessential; I should go up to the
bookie who looked as if he had the most money, and should say to 
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shout so loud; you are making yourself 
hoarse.&nbsp; Just listen to me.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s the hero of 
this novel?&nbsp; Oh, that&rsquo;s he, is it?&nbsp; The 
heavy-looking man on the little brown horse that keeps coughing 
and is suffering apparently from bone spavin?&nbsp; Well, what 
are the odds against his winning by ten lengths?&nbsp; A thousand
to one!&nbsp; Very well!&nbsp; Have you got a 
bag?&mdash;Good.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s twenty-seven pounds in gold 
and eighteen shillings in silver.&nbsp; Coat and waistcoat, say 
another ten shillings.&nbsp; Shirt and trousers&mdash;it&rsquo;s 
all right, I&rsquo;ve got my pyjamas on underneath&mdash;say 
seven and six.&nbsp; Boots&mdash;we won&rsquo;t 
quarrel&mdash;make it five bob.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s twenty-nine 
pounds and sixpence, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; In addition 
here&rsquo;s a mortgage on the family estate, which I&rsquo;ve 
had made out in blank, an I O U for fourteen pounds which has 
been owing to me now for some time, and this bundle of securities
which, strictly speaking, belong to my Aunt Jane.&nbsp; You keep 
that little lot till after the race, and we will call it in round
figures, five hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That single afternoon would thus bring me in five hundred 
thousand pounds&mdash;provided the bookie did not blow his brains
out.</p>
<p>Backers in Novel-land do not seem to me to know their way 
about.&nbsp; If the hero of the popular novel swims at all, it is
not like an ordinary human being that he does it.&nbsp; You never
meet him in a swimming-bath; he never pays ninepence, like the 
rest of us, for a machine.&nbsp; He goes out at uncanny hours, 
generally accompanied by a lady friend, with whom the while 
swimming he talks poetry and cracks jokes.&nbsp; Some of us, when
we try to talk in the sea, fill ourselves up with salt 
water.&nbsp; This chap lies on his back and carols, and the wild 
waves, seeing him, go round the other way.&nbsp; At billiards he 
can give the average sharper forty in a hundred.&nbsp; He does 
not really want to play; he does it to teach these bad men a 
lesson.&nbsp; He has not handled a cue for years.&nbsp; He picked
up the game when a young man in Australia, and it seems to have 
lingered with him.</p>
<p>He does not have to get up early and worry dumb-bells in his 
nightshirt; he just lies on a sofa in an elegant attitude and 
muscle comes to him.&nbsp; If his horse declines to jump a hedge,
he slips down off the animal&rsquo;s back and throws the poor 
thing over; it saves argument.&nbsp; If he gets cross and puts 
his shoulder to the massive oaken door, we know there is going to
be work next morning for the carpenter.&nbsp; Maybe he is a party
belonging to the Middle Ages.&nbsp; Then when he reluctantly 
challenges the crack fencer of Europe to a duel, our instinct is 
to call out and warn his opponent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You silly fool,&rdquo; one feels one wants to say; 
&ldquo;why, it is the hero of the novel!&nbsp; You take a 
friend&rsquo;s advice while you are still alive, and get out of 
it anyway&mdash;anyhow.&nbsp; Apologize&mdash;hire a horse and 
cart, do something.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not going to fight a duel,
you&rsquo;re going to commit suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the hero is a modern young man, and has not got a father, 
or has only something not worth calling a father, then he comes 
across a library&mdash;anybody&rsquo;s library does for 
him.&nbsp; He passes Sir Walter Scott and the &ldquo;Arabian 
Nights,&rdquo; and makes a bee-line for Plato; it seems to be an 
instinct with him.&nbsp; By help of a dictionary he worries it 
out in the original Greek.&nbsp; This gives him a passion for 
Greek.</p>
<p>When he has romped through the Greek classics he plays about 
among the Latins.&nbsp; He spends most of his spare time in that 
library, and forgets to go to tea.</p>
<h3>Because he always &ldquo;gets there,&rdquo; without any 
trouble.</h3>
<p>That is the sort of boy he is.&nbsp; How I used to hate 
him!&nbsp; If he has a proper sort of father, then he goes to 
college.&nbsp; He does no work: there is no need for him to work:
everything seems to come to him.&nbsp; That was another grievance
of mine against him.&nbsp; I always had to work a good deal, and 
very little came of it.&nbsp; He fools around doing things that 
other men would be sent down for; but in his case the professors 
love him for it all the more.&nbsp; He is the sort of man who 
can&rsquo;t do wrong.&nbsp; A fortnight before the examination he
ties a wet towel round his head.&nbsp; That is all we hear about 
it.&nbsp; It seems to be the towel that does it.&nbsp; Maybe, if 
the towel is not quite up to its work, he will help things on by 
drinking gallons of strong tea.&nbsp; The tea and the towel 
combined are irresistible: the result is always the senior 
wranglership.</p>
<p>I used to believe in that wet towel and that strong tea.&nbsp;
Lord! the things I used to believe when I was young.&nbsp; They 
would make an Encyclop&aelig;dia of Useless Knowledge.&nbsp; I 
wonder if the author of the popular novel has ever tried working 
with a wet towel round his or her head: I have.&nbsp; It is 
difficult enough to move a yard, balancing a dry towel.&nbsp; A 
heathen Turk may have it in his blood to do so: the ordinary 
Christian has not got the trick of it.&nbsp; To carry about a wet
towel twisted round one&rsquo;s head needs a trained 
acrobat.&nbsp; Every few minutes the wretched thing works 
loose.&nbsp; In darkness and in misery, you struggle to get your 
head out of a clammy towel that clings to you almost with 
passion.&nbsp; Brain power is wasted in inventing names for that 
towel&mdash;names expressive of your feelings with regard to 
it.&nbsp; Further time is taken up before the glass, fixing the 
thing afresh.</p>
<p>You return to your books in the wrong temper, the water 
trickles down your nose, runs in rivulets down your back.&nbsp; 
Until you have finally flung the towel out of the window and 
rubbed yourself dry, work is impossible.&nbsp; The strong tea 
always gave me indigestion, and made me sleepy.&nbsp; Until I had
got over the effects of the tea, attempts at study were 
useless.</p>
<h3>Because he&rsquo;s so damned clever.</h3>
<p>But the thing that still irritates me most against the hero of
the popular novel is the ease with which he learns a modern 
foreign language.&nbsp; Were he a German waiter, a Swiss barber, 
or a Polish photographer, I would not envy him; these people do 
not have to learn a language.&nbsp; My idea is that they boil 
down a dictionary, and take two table-spoonsful each night before
going to bed.&nbsp; By the time the bottle is finished they have 
the language well into their system.&nbsp; But he is not.&nbsp; 
He is just an ordinary Anglo-Saxon, and I don&rsquo;t believe in 
him.&nbsp; I walk about for years with dictionaries in my 
pocket.&nbsp; Weird-looking ladies and gentlemen gesticulate and 
rave at me for months.&nbsp; I hide myself in lonely places, 
repeating idioms to myself out loud, in the hope that by this 
means they will come readily to me if ever I want them, which I 
never do.&nbsp; And, after all this, I don&rsquo;t seem to know 
very much.&nbsp; This irritating ass, who has never left his 
native suburb, suddenly makes up his mind to travel on the 
Continent.&nbsp; I find him in the next chapter engaged in 
complicated psychological argument with French or German 
<i>savants</i>.&nbsp; It appears&mdash;the author had forgotten 
to mention it before&mdash;that one summer a French, or German, 
or Italian refugee, as the case may happen to be, came to live in
the hero&rsquo;s street: thus it is that the hero is able to talk
fluently in the native language of that unhappy refugee.</p>
<p>I remember a melodrama visiting a country town where I was 
staying.&nbsp; The heroine and child were sleeping peacefully in 
the customary attic.&nbsp; For some reason not quite clear to me,
the villain had set fire to the house.&nbsp; He had been 
complaining through the three preceding acts of the 
heroine&rsquo;s coldness; maybe it was with some idea of warming 
her.&nbsp; Escape by way of the staircase was impossible.&nbsp; 
Each time the poor girl opened the door a flame came in and 
nearly burned her hair off.&nbsp; It seemed to have been waiting 
for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; said the lady, hastily wrapping the 
child in a sheet, &ldquo;that I was brought up a wire 
walker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation she opened the attic 
window and took the nearest telegraph wire to the opposite side 
of the street.</p>
<p>In the same way, apparently, the hero of the popular novel, 
finding himself stranded in a foreign land, suddenly recollects 
that once upon a time he met a refugee, and at once begins to 
talk.&nbsp; I have met refugees myself.&nbsp; The only thing they
have ever taught me is not to leave my brandy flask about.</p>
<h3>And, finally, because I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s 
true.</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in these heroes and heroines that cannot
keep quiet in a foreign language they have taught themselves in 
an old-world library.&nbsp; My fixed idea is that they muddle 
along like the rest of us, surprised that so few people 
understand them, begging everyone they meet not to talk so 
quickly.&nbsp; These brilliant conversations with foreign 
philosophers!&nbsp; These passionate interviews with foreign 
countesses!&nbsp; They fancy they have had them.</p>
<p>I crossed once with an English lady from Boulogne to 
Folkestone.&nbsp; At Folkestone a little French 
girl&mdash;anxious about her train&mdash;asked us a simple 
question.&nbsp; My companion replied to it with an ease that 
astonished herself.&nbsp; The little French girl vanished; my 
companion sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so odd,&rdquo; said my companion, &ldquo;but
I seem to know quite a lot of French the moment I get back to 
England.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>How to be Healthy and Unhappy.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;They do say,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Wilkins, as she took 
the cover off the dish and gave a finishing polish to my plate 
with the cleanest corner of her apron, &ldquo;that 
&rsquo;addicks, leastways in May, ain&rsquo;t, strictly speaking,
the safest of food.&nbsp; But then, if you listen to all they 
say, it seems to me, we&rsquo;d have to give up victuals 
altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The haddock, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;is 
a savoury and nourishing dish, the &lsquo;poor man&rsquo;s 
steak&rsquo; I believe it is commonly called.&nbsp; When I was 
younger, Mrs. Wilkins, they were cheaper.&nbsp; For twopence one 
could secure a small specimen, for fourpence one of generous 
proportions.&nbsp; In the halcyon days of youth, when one&rsquo;s
lexicon contained not the word failure (it has crept into later 
editions, Mrs. Wilkins, the word it was found was occasionally 
needful), the haddock was of much comfort and support to me, a 
very present help in time of trouble.&nbsp; In those days a kind 
friend, without intending it, nearly brought about my death by 
slow starvation.&nbsp; I had left my umbrella in an omnibus, and 
the season was rainy.&nbsp; The kind rich friend gave me a new 
umbrella; it was a rich man&rsquo;s umbrella; we made an 
ill-assorted pair.&nbsp; Its handle was of ivory, imposing in 
appearance, ornamented with a golden snake.</p>
<h3>The unsympathetic Umbrella.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Following my own judgment I should have pawned that 
umbrella, purchased one more suited to my state in life, and 
&lsquo;blued&rsquo; the difference.&nbsp; But I was fearful of 
offending my one respectable acquaintance, and for weeks 
struggled on, hampered by this plutocratic appendage.&nbsp; The 
humble haddock was denied to me.&nbsp; Tied to this imposing 
umbrella, how could I haggle with fishmongers for haddocks.&nbsp;
At first sight of me&mdash;or, rather, of my umbrella&mdash;they 
flew to icy cellars, brought up for my inspection soles at 
eighteenpence a pound, recommended me prime parts of salmon, 
which my landlady would have fried in a pan reeking with the 
mixed remains of pork chops, rashers of bacon and cheese.&nbsp; 
It was closed to me, the humble coffee shop, where for threepence
I could have strengthened my soul with half a pint of cocoa and 
four &ldquo;doorsteps&rdquo;&mdash;satisfactory slices of bread 
smeared with a yellow grease that before the days of County 
Council inspectors they called butter.&nbsp; You know of them, 
Mrs. Wilkins?&nbsp; At sight of such nowadays I should turn up my
jaded nose.&nbsp; But those were the days of my youth, Mrs. 
Wilkins.&nbsp; The scent of a thousand hopes was in my nostrils: 
so they smelt good to me.&nbsp; The fourpenny beefsteak pie, 
satisfying to the verge of repletion; the succulent saveloy, were
not for the owner of the ivory-handled umbrella.&nbsp; On Mondays
and Tuesdays, perhaps, I could enjoy life at the rate of five 
hundred a year&mdash;clean serviette a penny extra, and twopence 
to the waiter, whose income must have been at least four times my
own.&nbsp; But from Wednesday to Saturday I had to wander in the 
wilderness of back streets and silent squares dinnerless, where 
there were not even to be found locusts and wild honey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, as I have said, a rainy season, and an umbrella
of some sort was a necessity.&nbsp; Fortunately&mdash;or I might 
not be sitting here, Mrs. Wilkins, talking to you now&mdash;my 
one respectable acquaintance was called away to foreign lands, 
and that umbrella I promptly put &lsquo;up the 
spout.&rsquo;&nbsp; You understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilkins admitted she did, but was of opinion that 
twenty-five per cent., to say nothing of the halfpenny for the 
ticket every time, was a wicked imposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did not trouble me, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I replied, 
&ldquo;in this particular instance.&nbsp; It was my determination
never to see that umbrella again.&nbsp; The young man behind the 
counter seemed suspicious, and asked where I got it from.&nbsp; I
told him that a friend had given it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did he know that he had given it to you?&rdquo; 
demanded the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon which I gave him a piece of my mind concerning the
character of those who think evil of others, and he gave me five 
and six, and said he should know me again; and I purchased an 
umbrella suited to my rank and station, and as fine a haddock as 
I have ever tasted with the balance, which was sevenpence, for I 
was feeling hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The haddock is an excellent fish, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; 
I said, &ldquo;and if, as you observe, we listened to all that 
was said we&rsquo;d be hungrier at forty, with a balance to our 
credit at the bank, than ever we were at twenty, with &lsquo;no 
effects&rsquo; beyond a sound digestion.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A Martyr to Health.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;There was a gent in Middle Temple Lane,&rdquo; said 
Mrs. Wilkins, &ldquo;as I used to do for.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my 
belief as &rsquo;e killed &rsquo;imself worrying twenty-four 
hours a day over what &rsquo;e called &rsquo;is 
&rsquo;ygiene.&nbsp; Leastways &rsquo;e&rsquo;s dead and buried 
now, which must be a comfort to &rsquo;imself, feeling as at last
&rsquo;e&rsquo;s out of danger.&nbsp; All &rsquo;is time &rsquo;e
spent taking care of &rsquo;imself&mdash;didn&rsquo;t seem to 
&rsquo;ave a leisure moment in which to live.&nbsp; For 
&rsquo;alf an hour every morning &rsquo;e&rsquo;d lie on 
&rsquo;is back on the floor, which is a draughty place, I always 
&rsquo;old, at the best of times, with nothing on but &rsquo;is 
pyjamas, waving &rsquo;is arms and legs about, and twisting 
&rsquo;imself into shapes unnatural to a Christian.&nbsp; Then 
&rsquo;e found out that everything &rsquo;e&rsquo;d been doing on
&rsquo;is back was just all wrong, so &rsquo;e turned over and 
did tricks on &rsquo;is stomach&mdash;begging your pardon for 
using the word&mdash;that you&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave thought more fit
and proper to a worm than to a man.&nbsp; Then all that was 
discovered to be a mistake.&nbsp; There don&rsquo;t seem nothing 
certain in these matters.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the awkward part of 
it, so it seems to me.&nbsp; &rsquo;E got &rsquo;imself a 
machine, by means of which &rsquo;e&rsquo;d &rsquo;ang 
&rsquo;imself up to the wall, and behave for all the world like a
beetle with a pin stuck through &rsquo;im, poor thing.&nbsp; It 
used to give me the shudders to catch sight of &rsquo;im through 
the &rsquo;alf-open door.&nbsp; For that was part of the game: 
you &rsquo;ad to &rsquo;ave a current of air through the room, 
the result of which was that for six months out of the year 
&rsquo;e&rsquo;d be coughing and blowing &rsquo;is nose from 
morning to night.&nbsp; It was the new treatment, so 
&rsquo;e&rsquo;d explain to me.&nbsp; You got yourself accustomed
to draughts so that they didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;urt you, and if you 
died in the process that only proved that you never ought to 
&rsquo;ave been born.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there came in this new Japanese business, and 
&rsquo;e&rsquo;d &rsquo;ire a little smiling &rsquo;eathen to 
chuck &rsquo;im about &rsquo;is room for &rsquo;alf an hour every
morning after breakfast.&nbsp; It got on my nerves after a while 
&rsquo;earing &rsquo;im being bumped on the floor every minute, 
or flung with &rsquo;is &rsquo;ead into the fire-place.&nbsp; But
&rsquo;e always said it was doing &rsquo;im good.&nbsp; 
&rsquo;E&rsquo;d argue that it freshened up &rsquo;is 
liver.&nbsp; It was &rsquo;is liver that &rsquo;e seemed to live 
for&mdash;didn&rsquo;t appear to &rsquo;ave any other interest in
life.&nbsp; It was the same with &rsquo;is food.&nbsp; One year 
it would be nothing but meat, and next door to raw at that.&nbsp;
One of them medical papers &rsquo;ad suddenly discovered that we 
were intended to be a sort of wild beast.&nbsp; The wonder to me 
is that &rsquo;e didn&rsquo;t go out &rsquo;unting chickens with 
a club, and bring &rsquo;em &rsquo;ome and eat &rsquo;em on the 
mat without any further fuss.&nbsp; For drink it would be boiling
water that burnt my fingers merely &rsquo;andling the 
glass.&nbsp; Then some other crank came out with the information 
that every other crank was wrong&mdash;which, taken by itself, 
sounds natural enough&mdash;that meat was fatal to the 
&rsquo;uman system.&nbsp; Upon that &rsquo;e becomes all at once 
a raging, tearing vegetarian, and trouble enough I &rsquo;ad 
learning twenty different ways of cooking beans, which 
didn&rsquo;t make, so far as I could ever see, the slightest 
difference&mdash;beans they were, and beans they tasted like, 
whether you called them <i>rago&ucirc;t &agrave; la maison</i>, 
or cutlets <i>&agrave; la Pompadour</i>.&nbsp; But it seemed to 
please &rsquo;im.</p>
<h3>He was never pig-headed.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Then vegetarianism turned out to be the mistake of our 
lives.&nbsp; It seemed we made an error giving up monkeys&rsquo; 
food.&nbsp; That was our natural victuals; nuts with occasional 
bananas.&nbsp; As I used to tell &rsquo;im, if that was so, then 
for all we &rsquo;ad got out of it we might just as well have 
stopped up a tree&mdash;saved rent and shoe leather.&nbsp; But 
&rsquo;e was one of that sort that don&rsquo;t seem able to 
&rsquo;elp believing everything they read in print.&nbsp; If one 
of those papers &rsquo;ad told &rsquo;im to live on the shells 
and throw away the nuts, &rsquo;e&rsquo;d have made a 
conscientious endeavour to do so, contending that &rsquo;is 
failure to digest them was merely the result of vicious 
training&mdash;didn&rsquo;t seem to &rsquo;ave any likes or 
dislikes of &rsquo;is own.&nbsp; You might &rsquo;ave thought 
&rsquo;e was just a bit of public property made to be 
experimented upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the daily papers interviewed an old gent, as 
said &rsquo;e was a &rsquo;undred, and I will say from &rsquo;is 
picture as any&rsquo;ow &rsquo;e looked it.&nbsp; &rsquo;E said 
it was all the result of never &rsquo;aving swallowed anything 
&rsquo;ot, upon which my gentleman for a week lives on cold 
porridge, if you&rsquo;ll believe me; although myself I&rsquo;d 
rather &rsquo;ave died at fifty and got it over.&nbsp; Then 
another paper dug up from somewhere a sort of animated corpse 
that said was a &rsquo;undred and two, and attributed the 
unfortunate fact to &rsquo;is always &rsquo;aving &rsquo;ad 
&rsquo;is food as &rsquo;ot as &rsquo;e could swallow it.&nbsp; A
bit of sense did begin to dawn upon &rsquo;im then, but too late 
in the day, I take it.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;d played about with 
&rsquo;imself too long.&nbsp; &rsquo;E died at thirty-two, 
looking to all appearance sixty, and you can&rsquo;t say as 
&rsquo;ow it was the result of not taking advice.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Only just in time.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;On this subject of health we are much too ready to 
follow advice,&rdquo; I agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;A cousin of mine, 
Mrs. Wilkins, had a wife who suffered occasionally from 
headache.&nbsp; No medicine relieved her of them&mdash;not 
altogether.&nbsp; And one day by chance she met a friend who 
said: &lsquo;Come straight with me to Dr. Blank,&rsquo; who 
happened to be a specialist famous for having invented a new 
disease that nobody until the year before had ever heard 
of.&nbsp; She accompanied her friend to Dr. Blank, and in less 
than ten minutes he had persuaded her that she had got this new 
disease, and got it badly; and that her only chance was to let 
him cut her open and have it out.&nbsp; She was a tolerably 
healthy woman, with the exception of these occasional headaches, 
but from what that specialist said it was doubtful whether she 
would get home alive, unless she let him operate on her then and 
there, and her friend, who appeared delighted, urged her not to 
commit suicide, as it were, by missing her turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The result was she consented, and afterwards went home 
in a four-wheeled cab, and put herself to bed.&nbsp; Her husband,
when he returned in the evening and was told, was furious.&nbsp; 
He said it was all humbug, and by this time she was ready to 
agree with him.&nbsp; He put on his hat, and started to give that
specialist a bit of his mind.&nbsp; The specialist was out, and 
he had to bottle up his rage until the morning.&nbsp; By then, 
his wife now really ill for the first time in her life, his 
indignation had reached boiling point.&nbsp; He was at that 
specialist&rsquo;s door at half-past nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; At
half-past eleven he came back, also in a four-wheeled cab, and 
day and night nurses for both of them were wired for.&nbsp; He 
also, it appeared, had arrived at that specialist&rsquo;s door 
only just in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this appendy&mdash;whatever they call 
it,&rdquo; commented Mrs. Wilkins, &ldquo;why a dozen years ago 
one poor creature out of ten thousand may possibly &rsquo;ave 
&rsquo;ad something wrong with &rsquo;is innards.&nbsp; To-day 
you ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;ardly considered respectable unless 
you&rsquo;ve got it, or &rsquo;ave &rsquo;ad it.&nbsp; I 
&rsquo;ave no patience with their talk.&nbsp; To listen to some 
of them you&rsquo;d think as Nature &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t made a 
man&mdash;not yet: would never understand the principle of the 
thing till some of these young chaps &rsquo;ad shown &rsquo;er 
&rsquo;ow to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>How to avoid Everything.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;They have now discovered, Mrs. Wilkins,&rdquo; I said, 
&ldquo;the germ of old age.&nbsp; They are going to inoculate us 
for it in early youth, with the result that the only chance of 
ever getting rid of our friends will be to give them a 
motor-car.&nbsp; And maybe it will not do to trust to that for 
long.&nbsp; They will discover that some men&rsquo;s tendency 
towards getting themselves into trouble is due to some sort of a 
germ.&nbsp; The man of the future, Mrs. Wilkins, will be 
inoculated against all chance of gas explosions, storms at sea, 
bad oysters, and thin ice.&nbsp; Science may eventually discover 
the germ prompting to ill-assorted marriages, proneness to invest
in the wrong stock, uncontrollable desire to recite poetry at 
evening parties.&nbsp; Religion, politics, education&mdash;all 
these things are so much wasted energy.&nbsp; To live happy and 
good for ever and ever, all we have to do is to hunt out these 
various germs and wring their necks for them&mdash;or whatever 
the proper treatment may be.&nbsp; Heaven, I gather from medical 
science, is merely a place that is free from germs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We talk a lot about it,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Wilkins, 
&ldquo;but it does not seem to me that we are very much better 
off than before we took to worrying ourselves for twenty-four 
&rsquo;ours a day about &rsquo;ow we are going to live.&nbsp; 
Lord! to read the advertisements in the papers you would think as
&rsquo;ow flesh and blood was never intended to &rsquo;ave any 
natural ills.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you ever &rsquo;ave a pain in your 
back?&rsquo; because, if so, there&rsquo;s a picture of a kind 
gent who&rsquo;s willing for one and sixpence halfpenny to take 
it quite away from you&mdash;make you look forward to scrubbing 
floors, and standing over the wash-tub six &rsquo;ours at a 
stretch like to a beanfeast.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you ever feel as 
though you don&rsquo;t want to get out of bed in the 
morning?&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all to be cured by a bottle of their
stuff&mdash;or two at the outside.&nbsp; Four children to keep, 
and a sick &rsquo;usband on your &rsquo;ands used to get me over 
it when I was younger.&nbsp; I used to fancy it was just because 
I was tired.</p>
<h3>The one Cure-All.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some of them seem to think,&rdquo; 
continued Mrs. Wilkins, &ldquo;that if you don&rsquo;t get all 
you want out of this world, and ain&rsquo;t so &rsquo;appy as 
you&rsquo;ve persuaded yourself you ought to be, that it&rsquo;s 
all because you ain&rsquo;t taking the right medicine.&nbsp; 
Appears to me there&rsquo;s only one doctor as can do for you, 
all the others talk as though they could, and &rsquo;e only comes
to each of us once, and then &rsquo;e makes no charge.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>Europe and the bright American Girl.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;How does she do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is what the European girl wants to know.&nbsp; The 
American girl!&nbsp; She comes over here, and, as a British 
matron, reduced to slang by force of indignation, once exclaimed 
to me: &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think the whole blessed show belonged 
to her.&rdquo;&nbsp; The European girl is hampered by her 
relatives.&nbsp; She has to account for her father: to explain 
away, if possible, her grandfather.&nbsp; The American girl 
sweeps them aside:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about them,&rdquo; she says to 
the Lord Chamberlain.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully good of 
you, but don&rsquo;t you fuss yourself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m looking 
after my old people.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my department.&nbsp; What
I want you to do is just to listen to what I am saying and then 
hustle around.&nbsp; I can fill up your time all right by 
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father may be a soap-boiler, her grandmother may have gone
out charing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she says to her 
Ambassador: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not coming.&nbsp; You just take 
my card and tell the King that when he&rsquo;s got a few minutes 
to spare I&rsquo;ll be pleased to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the extraordinary thing is that, a day or two afterwards, 
the invitation arrives.</p>
<p>A modern writer has said that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Murrican&rdquo;
is the <i>Civis Romanus sum</i> of the present-day woman&rsquo;s 
world.&nbsp; The late King of Saxony, did, I believe, on one 
occasion make a feeble protest at being asked to receive the 
daughter of a retail bootmaker.&nbsp; The young lady, nonplussed 
for the moment, telegraphed to her father in Detroit.&nbsp; The 
answer came back next morning: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t call it 
selling&mdash;practically giving them away.&nbsp; See 
Advertisement.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lady was presented as the 
daughter of an eminent philanthropist.</p>
<p>It is due to her to admit that, taking her as a class, the 
American girl is a distinct gain to European Society.&nbsp; Her 
influence is against convention and in favour of 
simplicity.&nbsp; One of her greatest charms, in the eyes of the 
European man, is that she listens to him.&nbsp; I cannot say 
whether it does her any good.&nbsp; Maybe she does not remember 
it all, but while you are talking she does give you her 
attention.&nbsp; The English woman does not always.&nbsp; She 
greets you pleasantly enough:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve so often wanted to meet you,&rdquo; she 
says, &ldquo;must you really go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It strikes you as sudden: you had no intention of going for 
hours.&nbsp; But the hint is too plain to be ignored.&nbsp; You 
are preparing to agree that you really must when, looking round, 
you gather that the last remark was not addressed to you, but to 
another gentleman who is shaking hands with her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, perhaps we shall be able to talk for five 
minutes,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve so often wanted
to say that I shall never forgive you.&nbsp; You have been simply
horrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again you are confused, until you jump to the conclusion that 
the latter portion of the speech is probably intended for quite 
another party with whom, at the moment, her back towards you, she
is engaged in a whispered conversation.&nbsp; When he is gone she
turns again to you.&nbsp; But the varied expressions that pass 
across her face while you are discussing with her the 
disadvantages of Protection, bewilder you.&nbsp; When, explaining
your own difficulty in arriving at a conclusion, you remark that 
Great Britain is an island, she roguishly shakes her head.&nbsp; 
It is not that she has forgotten her geography, it is that she is
conducting a conversation by signs with a lady at the other end 
of the room.&nbsp; When you observe that the working classes must
be fed, she smiles archly while murmuring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you really think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are about to say something strong on the subject of 
dumping.&nbsp; Apparently she has disappeared.&nbsp; You find 
that she is reaching round behind you to tap a new arrival with 
her fan.</p>
<h3>She has the Art of Listening.</h3>
<p>Now, the American girl looks at you, and just listens to you 
with her eyes fixed on you all the time.&nbsp; You gather that, 
as far as she is concerned, the rest of the company are passing 
shadows.&nbsp; She wants to hear what you have to say about 
Bi-metallism: her trouble is lest she may miss a word of 
it.&nbsp; From a talk with an American girl one comes away with 
the conviction that one is a brilliant conversationalist, who can
hold a charming woman spell-bound.&nbsp; This may not be good for
one: but while it lasts, the sensation is pleasant.</p>
<p>Even the American girl cannot, on all occasions, sweep from 
her path the cobwebs of old-world etiquette.&nbsp; Two American 
ladies told me a sad tale of things that had happened to them not
long ago in Dresden.&nbsp; An officer of rank and standing 
invited them to breakfast with him on the ice.&nbsp; Dames and 
nobles of the <i>plus haut ton</i> would be there.&nbsp; It is a 
social function that occurs every Sunday morning in Dresden 
during the skating season.&nbsp; The great lake in the Grosser 
Garten is covered with all sorts and conditions of people.&nbsp; 
Prince and commoner circle and recircle round one another.&nbsp; 
But they do not mix.&nbsp; The girls were pleased.&nbsp; They 
secured the services of an elderly lady, the widow of an 
analytical chemist: unfortunately, she could not skate.&nbsp; 
They wrapped her up and put her in a sledge.&nbsp; While they 
were in the <i>garde robe</i> putting on their skates, a German 
gentleman came up and bowed to them.</p>
<p>He was a nice young man of prepossessing appearance and 
amiable manners.&nbsp; They could not call to mind his name, but 
remembered having met him, somewhere, and on more than one 
occasion.&nbsp; The American girl is always sociable: they bowed 
and smiled, and said it was a fine day.&nbsp; He replied with 
volubility, and helped them down on to the ice.&nbsp; He was 
really most attentive.&nbsp; They saw their friend, the officer 
of noble family, and, with the assistance of the German 
gentleman, skated towards him.&nbsp; He glided past them.&nbsp; 
They thought that maybe he did not know enough to stop, so they 
turned and skated after him.&nbsp; They chased him three times 
round the pond and then, feeling tired, eased up and took counsel
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he must have seen us,&rdquo; said the 
younger girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;What does he mean by it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have not come down here to play 
forfeits,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;added to which I want my 
breakfast.&nbsp; You wait here a minute, I&rsquo;ll go and have 
it out with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was standing only a dozen yards away.&nbsp; Alone, though 
not a good performer on the ice, she contrived to cover half the 
distance dividing them.&nbsp; The officer, perceiving her, came 
to her assistance and greeted her with effusion.</p>
<h3>The Republican Idea in practice.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the lady, who was feeling indignant, 
&ldquo;I thought maybe you had left your glasses at 
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;but it is 
impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s impossible?&rdquo; demanded the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can be seen speaking to you,&rdquo; declared the
officer, &ldquo;while you are in company with that&mdash;that 
person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What person?&rdquo;&nbsp; She thought maybe he was 
alluding to the lady in the sledge.&nbsp; The chaperon was not 
showy, but, what is better, she was good.&nbsp; And, anyhow, it 
was the best the girls had been able to do.&nbsp; So far as they 
were concerned, they had no use for a chaperon.&nbsp; The idea 
had been a thoughtful concession to European prejudice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person in knickerbockers,&rdquo; explained the 
officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>that</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed the lady, relieved: 
&ldquo;he just came up and made himself agreeable while we were 
putting on our skates.&nbsp; We have met him somewhere, but I 
can&rsquo;t exactly fix him for the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have met him possibly at Wiesman&rsquo;s, in the 
Pragerstrasse: he is one of the attendants there,&rdquo; said the
officer.</p>
<p>The American girl is Republican in her ideas, but she draws 
the line at hairdressers.&nbsp; In theory it is absurd: the 
hairdresser is a man and a brother: but we are none of us logical
all the way.&nbsp; It made her mad, the thought that she had been
seen by all Dresden Society skating with a hairdresser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I do call that 
impudence.&nbsp; Why, they wouldn&rsquo;t do that even in 
Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she returned to where the hairdresser was illustrating to 
her friend the Dutch roll, determined to explain to him, as 
politely as possible, that although the free and enlightened 
Westerner has abolished social distinctions, he has not yet 
abolished them to that extent.</p>
<p>Had he been a commonplace German hairdresser he would have 
understood English, and all might have been easy.&nbsp; But to 
the &ldquo;classy&rdquo; German hairdresser, English is not so 
necessary, and the American ladies had reached, as regards their 
German, only the &ldquo;improving&rdquo; stage.&nbsp; In her 
excitement she confused the subjunctive and the imperative, and 
told him that he &ldquo;might&rdquo; go.&nbsp; He had no wish to 
go; he assured them&mdash;so they gathered&mdash;that his 
intention was to devote the morning to their service.&nbsp; He 
must have been a stupid man, but it is a type occasionally 
encountered.&nbsp; Two pretty women had greeted his advances with
apparent delight.&nbsp; They were Americans, and the American 
girl was notoriously unconventional.&nbsp; He knew himself to be 
a good-looking young fellow.&nbsp; It did not occur to him that 
in expressing willingness to dispense with his attendance they 
could be in earnest.</p>
<p>There was nothing for it, so it seemed to the girls, but to 
request the assistance of the officer, who continued to skate 
round and round them at a distance of about ten yards.&nbsp; So 
again the elder young lady, seizing her opportunity, made 
appeal.</p>
<h3>What the Soldier dared not do.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; persisted the officer, who, having 
been looking forward to a morning with two of the prettiest girls
in Dresden, was also feeling mad.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dare not be seen
speaking to a hairdresser.&nbsp; You must get rid of 
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;We do not know enough German, and he can&rsquo;t, or he 
won&rsquo;t, understand us.&nbsp; For goodness sake come and help
us.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be spending the whole morning with him if 
you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The German officer said he was desolate.&nbsp; Steps would be 
taken&mdash;later in the week&mdash;the result of which would 
probably be to render that young hairdresser prematurely 
bald.&nbsp; But, meanwhile, beyond skating round and round them, 
for which they did not even feel they wanted to thank him, the 
German officer could do nothing for them.&nbsp; They tried being 
rude to the hairdresser: he mistook it for American 
<i>chic</i>.&nbsp; They tried joining hands and running away from
him, but they were not good skaters, and he thought they were 
trying to show him the cake walk.&nbsp; They both fell down and 
hurt themselves, and it is difficult to be angry with a man, even
a hairdresser, when he is doing his best to pick you up and 
comfort you.</p>
<p>The chaperon was worse than useless.&nbsp; She was very 
old.&nbsp; She had been promised her breakfast, but saw no signs 
of it.&nbsp; She could not speak German; and remembered somewhat 
late in the day that two young ladies had no business to accept 
breakfast at the hands of German officers: and, if they did, at 
least they might see that they got it.&nbsp; She appeared to be 
willing to talk about decadence of modern manners to almost any 
extent, but the subject of the hairdresser, and how to get rid of
him, only bored her.</p>
<p>Their first stroke of luck occurred when the hairdresser, 
showing them the &ldquo;dropped three,&rdquo; fell down and 
temporarily stunned himself.&nbsp; It was not kind of them, but 
they were desperate.&nbsp; They flew for the bank just anyhow, 
and, scrambling over the grass, gained the restaurant.&nbsp; The 
officer, overtaking them at the door, led them to the table that 
had been reserved for them, then hastened back to hunt for the 
chaperon.&nbsp; The girls thought their trouble was over.&nbsp; 
Had they glanced behind them their joy would have been 
shorter-lived than even was the case.&nbsp; The hairdresser had 
recovered consciousness in time to see them waddling over the 
grass.&nbsp; He thought they were running to fetch him 
brandy.&nbsp; When the officer returned with the chaperon he 
found the hairdresser sitting opposite to them, explaining that 
he really was not hurt, and suggesting that, as they were there, 
perhaps they would like something to eat and drink.</p>
<p>The girls made one last frantic appeal to the man of buckram 
and pipeclay, but the etiquette of the Saxon Army was 
inexorable.&nbsp; It transpired that he might kill the 
hairdresser, but nothing else: he must not speak to him&mdash;not
even explain to the poor devil why it was that he was being 
killed.</p>
<h3>Her path of Usefulness.</h3>
<p>It did not seem quite worth it.&nbsp; They had some sandwiches
and coffee at the hairdresser&rsquo;s expense, and went home in a
cab: while the chaperon had breakfast with the officer of noble 
family.</p>
<p>The American girl has succeeded in freeing European social 
intercourse from many of its hide-bound conventions.&nbsp; There 
is still much work for her to do.&nbsp; But I have faith in 
her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>Music and the Savage.</h3>
<p>I never visit a music-hall without reflecting concerning the 
great future there must be before the human race.</p>
<p>How young we are, how very young!&nbsp; And think of all we 
have done!&nbsp; Man is still a mere boy.&nbsp; He has only just 
within the last half-century been put into trousers.&nbsp; Two 
thousand years ago he wore long clothes&mdash;the Grecian robe, 
the Roman toga.&nbsp; Then followed the Little Lord Fauntleroy 
period, when he went about dressed in a velvet suit with lace 
collar and cuffs, and had his hair curled for him.&nbsp; The late
lamented Queen Victoria put him into trousers.&nbsp; What a 
wonderful little man he will be when he is grown up!</p>
<p>A clergyman friend of mine told me of a German <i>Kurhaus</i> 
to which he was sent for his sins and his health.&nbsp; It was a 
resort, for some reason, specially patronized by the more elderly
section of the higher English middle class.&nbsp; Bishops were 
there, suffering from fatty degeneration of the heart caused by 
too close application to study; ancient spinsters of good family 
subject to spasms; gouty retired generals.&nbsp; Can anybody tell
me how many men in the British Army go to a general?&nbsp; 
Somebody once assured me it was five thousand, but that is 
absurd, on the face of it.&nbsp; The British Army, in that case, 
would have to be counted by millions.&nbsp; There are a goodish 
few American colonels still knocking about.&nbsp; The American 
colonel is still to be met with here and there by the curious 
traveller, but compared with the retired British general he is an
extinct species.&nbsp; In Cheltenham and Brighton and other 
favoured towns there are streets of nothing but retired British 
generals&mdash;squares of retired British generals&mdash;whole 
crescents of British generals.&nbsp; Abroad there are 
<i>pensions</i> with a special scale of charges for British 
generals.&nbsp; In Switzerland there has even been talk of 
reserving railway compartments &ldquo;For British Generals 
Only.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Germany, when you do not say distinctly and
emphatically on being introduced that you are not a British 
general, you are assumed, as a matter of course, to be a British 
general.&nbsp; During the Boer War, when I was residing in a 
small garrison town on the Rhine, German military men would draw 
me aside and ask of me my own private personal views as to the 
conduct of the campaign.&nbsp; I would give them my views freely,
explain to them how I would finish the whole thing in a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how in the face of the enemy&rsquo;s 
tactics&mdash;&rdquo; one of them would begin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother the enemy&rsquo;s tactics,&rdquo; I would 
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who cares for tactics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely a British general&mdash;&rdquo; they would 
persist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a British general?&rdquo; I 
would retort, &ldquo;I am talking to you merely as a plain 
commonsense man, with a head on my shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They would apologize for their mistake.&nbsp; But this is 
leading me away from that German <i>Kurhaus</i>.</p>
<h3>Recreation for the Higher clergy.</h3>
<p>My clergyman friend found life there dull.&nbsp; The generals 
and the spinsters left to themselves might have played cards, but
they thought of the poor bishops who would have had to look on 
envious.&nbsp; The bishops and the spinsters might have sung 
ballads, but the British general after dinner does not care for 
ballads, and had mentioned it.&nbsp; The bishops and the generals
might have told each other stories, but could not before the 
ladies.&nbsp; My clergyman friend stood the awful solemnity of 
three evenings, then cautiously felt his way towards 
revelry.&nbsp; He started with an intellectual game called 
&ldquo;Quotations.&rdquo;&nbsp; You write down quotations on a 
piece of paper, and the players have to add the author&rsquo;s 
name.&nbsp; It roped in four old ladies, and the youngest 
bishop.&nbsp; One or two generals tried a round, but not being 
familiar with quotations voted the game slow.</p>
<p>The next night my friend tried 
&ldquo;Consequences.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Saucy Miss A. met the 
gay General B. in&rdquo;&mdash;most unlikely places.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;He said.&rdquo;&nbsp; Really it was fortunate that General
B. remained too engrossed in the day before yesterday&rsquo;s 
<i>Standard</i> to overhear, or Miss A. could never have again 
faced him.&nbsp; &ldquo;And she replied.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
suppressed giggles excited the curiosity of the 
non-players.&nbsp; Most of the bishops and half the generals 
asked to be allowed to join.&nbsp; The giggles grew into 
roars.&nbsp; Those standing out found that they could not read 
their papers in comfort.</p>
<p>From &ldquo;Consequences&rdquo; the descent was easy.&nbsp; 
The tables and chairs were pushed against the walls, the bishops 
and the spinsters and the generals would sit in a ring upon the 
floor playing hunt the slipper.&nbsp; Musical chairs made the two
hours between bed and dinner the time of the day they all looked 
forward to: the steady trot with every nerve alert, the ear 
listening for the sudden stoppage of the music, the eye seeking 
with artfulness the likeliest chair, the volcanic silence, the 
mad scramble.</p>
<p>The generals felt themselves fighting their battles over 
again, the spinsters blushed and preened themselves, the bishops 
took interest in proving that even the Church could be prompt of 
decision and swift of movement.&nbsp; Before the week was out 
they were playing Puss-in-the-corner; ladies feeling young again 
were archly beckoning to stout deans, to whom were returning all 
the sensations of a curate.&nbsp; The swiftness with which the 
gouty generals found they could still hobble surprised even 
themselves.</p>
<h3>Why are we so young?</h3>
<p>But it is in the music-hall, as I have said, that I am most 
impressed with the youthfulness of man.&nbsp; How delighted we 
are when the long man in the little boy&rsquo;s hat, having asked
his short brother a riddle, and before he can find time to answer
it, hits him over the stomach with an umbrella!&nbsp; How we clap
our hands and shout with glee!&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t really his 
stomach: it is a bolster tied round his waist&mdash;we know that;
but seeing the long man whack at that bolster with an umbrella 
gives us almost as much joy as if the bolster were not there.</p>
<p>I laugh at the knockabout brothers, I confess, so long as they
are on the stage; but they do not convince me.&nbsp; Reflecting 
on the performance afterwards, my dramatic sense revolts against 
the &ldquo;plot.&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot accept the theory of their
being brothers.&nbsp; The difference in size alone is a strain 
upon my imagination.&nbsp; It is not probable that of two 
children of the same parents one should measure six foot six, and
the other five foot four.&nbsp; Even allowing for a freak of 
nature, and accepting the fact that they might be brothers, I do 
not believe they would remain so inseparable.&nbsp; The short 
brother would have succeeded before now in losing the long 
brother.&nbsp; Those continual bangings over the head and stomach
would have weakened whatever affection the short brother might 
originally have felt towards his long relation.&nbsp; At least, 
he would insist upon the umbrella being left at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go for a walk with you,&rdquo; he might say, 
&ldquo;I will stand stock still with you in Trafalgar Square in 
the midst of the traffic while you ask me silly riddles, but not 
if you persist in bringing with you that absurd umbrella.&nbsp; 
You are too handy with it.&nbsp; Put it back in the rack before 
we start, or go out by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides, my sense of justice is outraged.&nbsp; Why should the
short brother be banged and thumped without reason?&nbsp; The 
Greek dramatist would have explained to us that the shorter 
brother had committed a crime against the gods.&nbsp; 
Aristophanes would have made the longer brother the instrument of
the Furies.&nbsp; The riddles he asked would have had bearing 
upon the shorter brother&rsquo;s sin.&nbsp; In this way the 
spectator would have enjoyed amusement combined with the 
satisfactory sense that Nemesis is ever present in human 
affairs.&nbsp; I present the idea, for what it may be worth, to 
the concoctors of knockabout turns.</p>
<h3>Where Brotherly (and Sisterly) Love reigns supreme.</h3>
<p>The family tie is always strong on the music-hall stage.&nbsp;
The acrobatic troupe is always a &ldquo;Family&rdquo;: Pa, Ma, 
eight brothers and sisters, and the baby.&nbsp; A more 
affectionate family one rarely sees.&nbsp; Pa and Ma are a trifle
stout, but still active.&nbsp; Baby, dear little fellow, is full 
of humour.&nbsp; Ladies do not care to go on the music-hall stage
unless they can take their sister with them.&nbsp; I have seen a 
performance given by eleven sisters, all the same size and 
apparently all the same age.&nbsp; She must have been a wonderful
woman&mdash;the mother.&nbsp; They all had golden hair, and all 
wore precisely similar frocks&mdash;a charming but 
<i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;e</i> arrangement&mdash;in 
claret-coloured velvet over blue silk stockings.&nbsp; So far as 
I could gather, they all had the same young man.&nbsp; No doubt 
he found it difficult amongst them to make up his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrange it among yourselves,&rdquo; he no doubt had 
said, &ldquo;it is quite immaterial to me.&nbsp; You are so much 
alike, it is impossible that a fellow loving one should not love 
the lot of you.&nbsp; So long as I marry into the family I really
don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a performer appears alone on the music-hall stage it is 
easy to understand why.&nbsp; His or her domestic life has been a
failure.&nbsp; I listened one evening to six songs in 
succession.&nbsp; The first two were sung by a gentleman.&nbsp; 
He entered with his clothes hanging upon him in shreds.&nbsp; He 
explained that he had just come from an argument with his 
wife.&nbsp; He showed us the brick with which she had hit him, 
and the bump at the back of his head that had resulted.&nbsp; The
funny man&rsquo;s marriage is never a success.&nbsp; But really 
this seems to be his own fault.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was such a 
lovely girl,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;with a face&mdash;well, 
you&rsquo;d hardly call it a face, it was more like a gas 
explosion.&nbsp; Then she had those wonderful sort of eyes that 
you can see two ways at once with, one of them looks down the 
street, while the other one is watching round the corner.&nbsp; 
Can see you coming any way.&nbsp; And her mouth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appears that if she stands anywhere near the curb and 
smiles, careless people mistake her for a pillar-box, and drop 
letters into her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And such a voice!&rdquo;&nbsp; We are told it is a 
perfect imitation of a motor-car.&nbsp; When she laughs people 
spring into doorways to escape being run over.</p>
<p>If he will marry that sort of woman, what can he expect?&nbsp;
The man is asking for it.</p>
<p>The lady who followed him also told us a sad story of 
misplaced trust.&nbsp; She also was comic&mdash;so the programme 
assured us.&nbsp; The humorist appears to have no luck.&nbsp; She
had lent her lover money to buy the ring, and the licence, and to
furnish the flat.&nbsp; He did buy the ring, and he furnished the
flat, but it was for another lady.&nbsp; The audience 
roared.&nbsp; I have heard it so often asked, &ldquo;What is 
humour?&rdquo;&nbsp; From observation, I should describe it as 
other people&rsquo;s troubles.</p>
<p>A male performer followed her.&nbsp; He came on dressed in a 
night-shirt, carrying a baby.&nbsp; His wife, it seemed, had gone
out for the evening with the lodger.&nbsp; That was his 
joke.&nbsp; It was the most successful song of the whole six.</p>
<h3>The one sure Joke.</h3>
<p>A philosopher has put it on record that he always felt sad 
when he reflected on the sorrows of humanity.&nbsp; But when he 
reflected on its amusements he felt sadder still.</p>
<p>Why was it so funny that the baby had the lodger&rsquo;s 
nose?&nbsp; We laughed for a full minute by the clock.</p>
<p>Why do I love to see a flabby-faced man go behind curtains, 
and, emerging in a wig and a false beard, say that he is now 
Bismarck or Mr. Chamberlain?&nbsp; I have felt resentment against
the Lightning Impersonator ever since the days of Queen 
Victoria&rsquo;s Diamond Jubilee.&nbsp; During that summer every 
Lightning Impersonator ended his show by shouting, while the band
played the National Anthem, &ldquo;Queen Victoria!&rdquo;&nbsp; 
He was not a bit like Queen Victoria.&nbsp; He did not even, to 
my thinking, look a lady; but at once I had to stand up in my 
place and sing &ldquo;God save the Queen.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a 
time of enthusiastic loyalty; if you did not spring up quickly 
some patriotic old fool from the back would reach across and hit 
you over the head with the first thing he could lay his hands 
upon.</p>
<p>Other music-hall performers caught at the idea.&nbsp; By 
ending up with &ldquo;God save the Queen&rdquo; any performer, 
however poor, could retire in a whirlwind of applause.&nbsp; 
Niggers, having bored us with tiresome songs about coons and 
honeys and Swanee Rivers, would, as a last resource, strike up 
&ldquo;God save the Queen&rdquo; on the banjo.&nbsp; The whole 
house would have to rise and cheer.&nbsp; Elderly Sisters 
Trippet, having failed to arouse our enthusiasm by allowing us a 
brief glimpse of an ankle, would put aside all frivolity, and 
tell us of a hero lover named George, who had fought somebody 
somewhere for his Queen and country.&nbsp; &ldquo;He 
fell!&rdquo;&mdash;bang from the big drum and blue 
limelight.&nbsp; In a recumbent position he appears to have 
immediately started singing &ldquo;God save the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>How Anarchists are made.</h3>
<p>Sleepy members of the audience would be hastily awakened by 
their friends.&nbsp; We would stagger to our feet.&nbsp; The 
Sisters Trippet, with eyes fixed on the chandelier, would lead 
us: to the best of our ability we would sing &ldquo;God save the 
Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There have been evenings when I have sung &ldquo;God save the 
Queen&rdquo; six times.&nbsp; Another season of it, and I should 
have become a Republican.</p>
<p>The singer of patriotic songs is generally a stout and puffy 
man.&nbsp; The perspiration pours from his face as the result of 
the violent gesticulations with which he tells us how he stormed 
the fort.&nbsp; He must have reached it very hot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were ten to one agin us, boys.&rdquo;&nbsp; We 
feel that this was a miscalculation on the enemy&rsquo;s 
part.&nbsp; Ten to one &ldquo;agin&rdquo; such wildly 
gesticulating Britishers was inviting defeat.</p>
<p>It seems to have been a terrible battle notwithstanding.&nbsp;
He shows us with a real sword how it was done.&nbsp; Nothing 
could have lived within a dozen yards of that sword.&nbsp; The 
conductor of the orchestra looks nervous.&nbsp; Our fear is lest 
he will end by cutting off his own head.&nbsp; His recollections 
are carrying him away.&nbsp; Then follows 
&ldquo;Victory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gas men and the programme sellers cheer wildly.&nbsp; We 
conclude with the inevitable &ldquo;God save the King.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>The Ghost and the Blind Children.</h3>
<p>Ghosts are in the air.&nbsp; It is difficult at this moment to
avoid talking of ghosts.&nbsp; The first question you are asked 
on being introduced this season is:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in ghosts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would be so glad to believe in ghosts.&nbsp; This world is 
much too small for me.&nbsp; Up to a century or two ago the 
intellectual young man found it sufficient for his 
purposes.&nbsp; It still contained the unknown&mdash;the 
possible&mdash;within its boundaries.&nbsp; New continents were 
still to be discovered: we dreamt of giants, Liliputians, 
desert-fenced Utopias.&nbsp; We set our sail, and Wonderland lay 
ever just beyond our horizon.&nbsp; To-day the world is small, 
the light railway runs through the desert, the coasting steamer 
calls at the Islands of the Blessed, the last mystery has been 
unveiled, the fairies are dead, the talking birds are 
silent.&nbsp; Our baffled curiosity turns for relief 
outwards.&nbsp; We call upon the dead to rescue us from our 
monotony.&nbsp; The first authentic ghost will be welcomed as the
saviour of humanity.</p>
<p>But he must be a living ghost&mdash;a ghost we can respect, a 
ghost we can listen to.&nbsp; The poor spiritless addle-headed 
ghost that has hitherto haunted our blue chambers is of no use to
us.&nbsp; I remember a thoughtful man once remarking during 
argument that if he believed in ghosts&mdash;the silly, childish 
spooks about which we had been telling anecdotes&mdash;death 
would possess for him an added fear: the idea that his next 
dwelling-place would be among such a pack of dismal idiots would 
sadden his departing hours.&nbsp; What was he to talk to them 
about?&nbsp; Apparently their only interest lay in recalling 
their earthly troubles.&nbsp; The ghost of the lady unhappily 
married who had been poisoned, or had her throat cut, who every 
night for the last five hundred years had visited the chamber 
where it happened for no other purpose than to scream about it! 
what a tiresome person she would be to meet!&nbsp; All her 
conversation during the long days would be around her earthly 
wrongs.&nbsp; The other ghosts, in all probability, would have 
heard about that husband of hers, what he said, and what he did, 
till they were sick of the subject.&nbsp; A newcomer would be 
seized upon with avidity.</p>
<p>A lady of repute writes to a magazine that she once occupied 
for a season a wainscotted room in an old manor house.&nbsp; On 
several occasions she awoke in the night: each time to witness 
the same ghostly performance.&nbsp; Four gentlemen sat round a 
table playing cards.&nbsp; Suddenly one of them sprang to his 
feet and plunged a dagger into the back of his partner.&nbsp; The
lady does not say so: one presumes it was his partner.&nbsp; I 
have, myself, when playing bridge, seen an expression on my 
partner&rsquo;s face that said quite plainly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to murder you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have not the memory for bridge.&nbsp; I forget who it was 
that, last trick but seven, played the two of clubs.&nbsp; I 
thought it was he, my partner.&nbsp; I thought it meant that I 
was to take an early opportunity of forcing trumps.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t know why I thought so, I try to explain why I thought
so.&nbsp; It sounds a silly argument even to myself; I feel I 
have not got it quite right.&nbsp; Added to which it was not my 
partner who played the two of clubs, it was Dummy.&nbsp; If I had
only remembered this, and had concluded from it&mdash;as I ought 
to have done&mdash;that my partner had the ace of 
diamonds&mdash;as otherwise why did he pass my knave?&mdash;we 
might have saved the odd trick.&nbsp; I have not the head for 
bridge.&nbsp; It is only an ordinary head&mdash;mine.&nbsp; I 
have no business to play bridge.</p>
<h3>Why not, occasionally, a cheerful Ghost.</h3>
<p>But to return to our ghosts.&nbsp; These four gentlemen must 
now and again, during their earthly existence, have sat down to a
merry game of cards.&nbsp; There must have been evenings when 
nobody was stabbed.&nbsp; Why choose an unpleasant occasion to 
harp exclusively upon it?&nbsp; Why do ghosts never give a 
cheerful show?&nbsp; The lady who was poisoned! there must have 
been other evenings in her life.&nbsp; Why does she not show us 
&ldquo;The first meeting&rdquo;: when he gave her the violets and
said they were like her eyes?&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t always 
poisoning her.&nbsp; There must have been a period before he ever
thought of poisoning her.&nbsp; Cannot these ghosts do something 
occasionally in what is termed &ldquo;the lighter 
vein&rdquo;?&nbsp; If they haunt a forest glade, it is to perform
a duel to the death, or an assassination.&nbsp; Why cannot they, 
for a change, give us an old-time picnic, or &ldquo;The hawking 
party,&rdquo; which, in Elizabethan costume, should make a pretty
picture?&nbsp; Ghostland would appear to be obsessed by the 
spirit of the Scandinavian drama: murders, suicides, ruined 
fortunes, and broken hearts are the only material made use 
of.&nbsp; Why is not a dead humorist allowed now and then to 
write the sketch?&nbsp; There must be plenty of dead comic 
lovers; why are they never allowed to give a performance?</p>
<h3>Where are the dead Humorists?</h3>
<p>A cheerful person contemplates death with alarm.&nbsp; What is
he to do in this land of ghosts? there is no place for him.&nbsp;
Imagine the commonplace liver of a humdrum existence being 
received into ghostland.&nbsp; He enters nervous, shy, feeling 
again the new boy at school.&nbsp; The old ghosts gather round 
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you come here&mdash;murdered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, at least, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suicide?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;can&rsquo;t remember the name of it now.&nbsp;
Began with a chill on the liver, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghosts are disappointed.&nbsp; But a happy suggestion is 
made.&nbsp; Perhaps he was the murderer; that would be even 
better.&nbsp; Let him think carefully; can he recollect ever 
having committed a murder?&nbsp; He racks his brains in vain, not
a single murder comes to his recollection.&nbsp; He never forged 
a will.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t even know where anything is 
hid.&nbsp; Of what use will he be in ghostland?&nbsp; One 
pictures him passing the centuries among a moody crowd of 
uninteresting mediocrities, brooding perpetually over their 
wasted lives.&nbsp; Only the ghosts of ladies and gentlemen mixed
up in crime have any &ldquo;show&rdquo; in ghostland.</p>
<h3>The Spirit does not shine as a Conversationalist.</h3>
<p>I feel an equal dissatisfaction with the spirits who are 
supposed to return to us and communicate with us through the 
medium of three-legged tables.&nbsp; I do not deny the 
possibility that spirits exist.&nbsp; I am even willing to allow 
them their three-legged tables.&nbsp; It must be confessed it is 
a clumsy method.&nbsp; One cannot help regretting that during all
the ages they have not evolved a more dignified system.&nbsp; One
feels that the three-legged table must hamper them.&nbsp; One can
imagine an impatient spirit getting tired of spelling out a 
lengthy story on a three-legged table.&nbsp; But, as I have said,
I am willing to assume that, for some spiritual reason 
unfathomable to my mere human intelligence, that three-legged 
table is essential.&nbsp; I am willing also to accept the human 
medium.&nbsp; She is generally an unprepossessing lady running 
somewhat to bulk.&nbsp; If a gentleman, he so often has dirty 
finger-nails, and smells of stale beer.&nbsp; I think myself it 
would be so much simpler if the spirit would talk to me direct; 
we could get on quicker.&nbsp; But there is that about the 
medium, I am told, which appeals to a spirit.&nbsp; Well, it is 
his affair, not mine, and I waive the argument.&nbsp; My real 
stumbling-block is the spirit himself&mdash;the sort of 
conversation that, when he does talk, he indulges in.&nbsp; I 
cannot help feeling that his conversation is not worth the 
paraphernalia.&nbsp; I can talk better than that myself.</p>
<p>The late Professor Huxley, who took some trouble over this 
matter, attended some half-dozen <i>s&eacute;ances</i>, and then 
determined to attend no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for my sins to submit 
occasionally to the society of live bores.&nbsp; I refuse to go 
out of my way to spend an evening in the dark with dead 
bores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spiritualists themselves admit that their table-rapping 
spooks are precious dull dogs; it would be difficult, in face of 
the communications recorded, for them to deny it.&nbsp; They 
explain to us that they have not yet achieved communication with 
the higher spiritual Intelligences.&nbsp; The more intelligent 
spirits&mdash;for some reason that the spiritualists themselves 
are unable to explain&mdash;do not want to talk to them, appear 
to have something else to do.&nbsp; At present&mdash;so I am 
told, and can believe&mdash;it is only the spirits of lower 
intelligence that care to turn up on these evenings.&nbsp; The 
spiritualists argue that, by continuing, the higher-class spirits
will later on be induced to &ldquo;come in.&rdquo;&nbsp; I fail 
to follow the argument.&nbsp; It seems to me that we are 
frightening them away.&nbsp; Anyhow, myself I shall wait 
awhile.</p>
<p>When the spirit comes along that can talk sense, that can tell
me something I don&rsquo;t know, I shall be glad to meet 
him.&nbsp; The class of spirit that we are getting just at 
present does not appeal to me.&nbsp; The thought of him&mdash;the
reflection that I shall die and spend the rest of eternity in his
company&mdash;does not comfort me.</p>
<h3>She is now a Believer.</h3>
<p>A lady of my acquaintance tells me it is marvellous how much 
these spirits seem to know.&nbsp; On her very first visit, the 
spirit, through the voice of the medium&mdash;an elderly 
gentleman residing obscurely in Clerkenwell&mdash;informed her 
without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation that she possessed a relative
with the Christian name of George.&nbsp; (I am not making this 
up&mdash;it is real.)&nbsp; This gave her at first the idea that 
spiritualism was a fraud.&nbsp; She had no relative named 
George&mdash;at least, so she thought.&nbsp; But a morning or two
later her husband received a letter from Australia.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he glanced at the last 
page, &ldquo;I had forgotten all about the poor old 
beggar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom is it from?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nobody you know&mdash;haven&rsquo;t seen him myself
for twenty years&mdash;a third or fourth cousin of 
mine&mdash;George&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She never heard the surname, she was too excited.&nbsp; The 
spirit had been right from the beginning; she <i>had</i> a 
relative named George.&nbsp; Her faith in spiritualism is now as 
a rock.</p>
<p>There are thousands of folk who believe in Old Moore&rsquo;s 
Almanac.&nbsp; My difficulty would be not to believe in the old 
gentleman.&nbsp; I see that for the month of January last he 
foretold us that the Government would meet with determined and 
persistent opposition.&nbsp; He warned us that there would be 
much sickness about, and that rheumatism would discover its old 
victims.&nbsp; How does he know these things?&nbsp; Is it that 
the stars really do communicate with him, or does he &ldquo;feel 
it in his bones,&rdquo; as the saying is up North?</p>
<p>During February, he mentioned, the weather would be 
unsettled.&nbsp; He concluded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word Taxation will have a terrible significance for
both Government and people this month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really, it is quite uncanny.&nbsp; In March:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theatres will do badly during the month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seems to be no keeping anything from Old Moore.&nbsp; In
April &ldquo;much dissatisfaction will be expressed among Post 
Office employees.&rdquo;&nbsp; That sounds probable, on the face 
of it.&nbsp; In any event, I will answer for our local 
postman.</p>
<p>In May &ldquo;a wealthy magnate is going to die.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
In June there is going to be a fire.&nbsp; In July &ldquo;Old 
Moore has reason to fear there will be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do hope he may be wrong, and yet somehow I feel a conviction
that he won&rsquo;t be.&nbsp; Anyhow, one is glad it has been put
off till July.</p>
<p>In August &ldquo;one in high authority will be in danger of 
demise.&rdquo;&nbsp; In September &ldquo;zeal&rdquo; on the part 
of persons mentioned &ldquo;will outstrip 
discretion.&rdquo;&nbsp; In October Old Moore is afraid 
again.&nbsp; He cannot avoid a haunting suspicion that 
&ldquo;Certain people will be victimized by extensive fraudulent 
proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In November &ldquo;the public Press will have its columns full
of important news.&rdquo;&nbsp; The weather will be 
&ldquo;adverse,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a death will occur in high 
circles.&rdquo;&nbsp; This makes the second in one year.&nbsp; I 
am glad I do not belong to the higher circles.</p>
<h3>How does he do it?</h3>
<p>In December Old Moore again foresees trouble, just when I was 
hoping it was all over.&nbsp; &ldquo;Frauds will come to light, 
and death will find its victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all this information is given to us for a penny.</p>
<p>The palmist examines our hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will go a 
journey,&rdquo; he tells us.&nbsp; It is marvellous!&nbsp; How 
could he have known that only the night before we had been 
discussing the advisability of taking the children to Margate for
the holidays?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is trouble in store for you,&rdquo; he tells us, 
regretfully, &ldquo;but you will get over it.&rdquo;&nbsp; We 
feel that the future has no secret hidden from him.</p>
<p>We have &ldquo;presentiments&rdquo; that people we love, who 
are climbing mountains, who are fond of ballooning, are in 
danger.</p>
<p>The sister of a friend of mine who went out to the South 
African War as a volunteer had three presentiments of his 
death.&nbsp; He came home safe and sound, but admitted that on 
three distinct occasions he had been in imminent danger.&nbsp; It
seemed to the dear lady a proof of everything she had ever 
read.</p>
<p>Another friend of mine was waked in the middle of the night by
his wife, who insisted that he should dress himself and walk 
three miles across a moor because she had had a dream that 
something terrible was happening to a bosom friend of hers.&nbsp;
The bosom friend and her husband were rather indignant at being 
waked at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, but their indignation 
was mild compared with that of the dreamer on learning that 
nothing was the matter.&nbsp; From that day forward a coldness 
sprang up between the two families.</p>
<p>I would give much to believe in ghosts.&nbsp; The interest of 
life would be multiplied by its own square power could we 
communicate with the myriad dead watching us from their mountain 
summits.&nbsp; Mr. Zangwill, in a poem that should live, draws 
for us a pathetic picture of blind children playing in a garden, 
laughing, romping.&nbsp; All their lives they have lived in 
darkness; they are content.&nbsp; But, the wonder of it, could 
their eyes by some miracle be opened!</p>
<h3>Blind Children playing in a World of Darkness.</h3>
<p>May not we be but blind children, suggests the poet, living in
a world of darkness&mdash;laughing, weeping, loving, 
dying&mdash;knowing nothing of the wonder round us?</p>
<p>The ghosts about us, with their god-like faces, it might be 
good to look at them.</p>
<p>But these poor, pale-faced spooks, these dull-witted, 
table-thumping spirits: it would be sad to think that of such was
the kingdom of the Dead.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>Parents and their Teachers.</h3>
<p>My heart has been much torn of late, reading of the wrongs of 
Children.&nbsp; It has lately been discovered that Children are 
being hampered and harassed in their career by certain brutal and
ignorant persons called, for want of a better name, 
parents.&nbsp; The parent is a selfish wretch who, out of pure 
devilment, and without consulting the Child itself upon the 
subject, lures innocent Children into the world, apparently for 
the purpose merely of annoying them.&nbsp; The parent does not 
understand the Child when he has got it; he does not understand 
anything, not much.&nbsp; The only person who understands the 
Child is the young gentleman fresh from College and the elderly 
maiden lady, who, between them, produce most of the literature 
that explains to us the Child.</p>
<p>The parent does not even know how to dress the Child.&nbsp; 
The parent will persist in dressing the Child in a long and 
trailing garment that prevents the Child from kicking.&nbsp; The 
young gentleman fresh from College grows almost poetical in his 
contempt.&nbsp; It appears that the one thing essential for the 
health of a young child is that it should have perfect freedom to
kick.&nbsp; Later on the parent dresses the Child in short 
clothes, and leaves bits of its leg bare.&nbsp; The elderly 
maiden Understander of Children, quoting medical opinion, 
denounces us as criminals for leaving any portion of that 
precious leg uncovered.&nbsp; It appears that the partially 
uncovered leg of childhood is responsible for most of the disease
that flesh is heir to.</p>
<p>Then we put it into boots.&nbsp; We &ldquo;crush its 
delicately fashioned feet into hideous leather instruments of 
torture.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is the sort of phrase that is hurled 
at us!&nbsp; The picture conjured up is that of some fiend in 
human shape, calling itself a father, seizing some helpless 
cherub by the hair, and, while drowning its pathetic wails for 
mercy beneath roars of demon laughter, proceeding to bind about 
its tender bones some ancient curiosity dug from the dungeons of 
the Inquisition.</p>
<p>If the young gentleman fresh from College or the maiden lady 
Understander could be, if only for a month or two, a 
father!&nbsp; If only he or she could guess how gladly the father
of limited income would reply,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, you are wrong in saying that the children must
have boots.&nbsp; That is an exploded theory.&nbsp; The children 
must not have boots.&nbsp; I refuse to be a party to crushing 
their delicately fashioned feet into hideous leather instruments 
of torture.&nbsp; The young gentleman fresh from College and the 
elderly maiden Understander have decided that the children must 
not have boots.&nbsp; Do not let me hear again that out-of-date 
word&mdash;boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there were only one young gentleman fresh from College, one
maiden lady Understander teaching us our duty, life would be 
simpler.&nbsp; But there are so many young gentlemen from 
College, so many maiden lady Understanders, on the job&mdash;if I
may be permitted a vulgarism; and as yet they are not all 
agreed.&nbsp; It is distracting for the parent anxious to do 
right.&nbsp; We put the little dears into sandals, and then at 
once other young gentlemen from College, other maiden lady 
Understanders, point to us as would-be murderers.&nbsp; Long 
clothes are fatal, short clothes are deadly, boots are 
instruments of torture, to allow children to go about with bare 
feet shows that we regard them as Incumbrances, and, with low 
cunning, are seeking to be rid of them.</p>
<h3>Their first attempt.</h3>
<p>I knew a pair of parents.&nbsp; I am convinced, in spite of 
all that can be said to the contrary, they were fond of their 
Child; it was their first.&nbsp; They were anxious to do the 
right thing.&nbsp; They read with avidity all books and articles 
written on the subject of Children.&nbsp; They read that a Child 
should always sleep lying on its back, and took it in turns to 
sit awake o&rsquo; nights to make sure that the Child was always 
right side up.</p>
<p>But another magazine told them that Children allowed to sleep 
lying on their backs grew up to be idiots.&nbsp; They were sad 
they had not read of this before, and started the Child on its 
right side.&nbsp; The Child, on the contrary, appeared to have a 
predilection for the left, the result being that neither the 
parents nor the baby itself for the next three weeks got any 
sleep worth speaking of.</p>
<p>Later on, by good fortune, they came across a treatise that 
said a Child should always be allowed to choose its own position 
while sleeping, and their friends persuaded them to stop at 
that&mdash;told them they would never strike a better article if 
they searched the whole British Museum Library.&nbsp; It troubled
them to find that Child sometimes sleeping curled up with its toe
in its mouth, and sometimes flat on its stomach with its head 
underneath the pillow.&nbsp; But its health and temper were 
decidedly improved.</p>
<h3>The Parent can do no right.</h3>
<p>There is nothing the parent can do right.&nbsp; You would 
think that now and then he might, if only by mere accident, 
blunder into sense.&nbsp; But, no, there seems to be a law 
against it.&nbsp; He brings home woolly rabbits and indiarubber 
elephants, and expects the Child to be contented 
&ldquo;forsooth&rdquo; with suchlike aids to its education.&nbsp;
As a matter of fact, the Child is content: it bangs its own head 
with the woolly rabbit and does itself no harm; it tries to 
swallow the indiarubber elephant; it does not succeed, but 
continues to hope.&nbsp; With that woolly rabbit and that 
indiarubber elephant it would be as happy as the day is long if 
only the young gentleman from Cambridge would leave it alone, and
not put new ideas into its head.&nbsp; But the gentleman from 
Cambridge and the maiden lady Understander are convinced that the
future of the race depends upon leaving the Child untrammelled to
select its own amusements.&nbsp; A friend of mine, during his 
wife&rsquo;s absence once on a visit to her mother, tried the 
experiment.</p>
<p>The Child selected a frying-pan.&nbsp; How it got the 
frying-pan remains to this day a mystery.&nbsp; The cook said 
&ldquo;frying-pans don&rsquo;t walk upstairs.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
nurse said she should be sorry to call anyone a liar, but that 
there was commonsense in everything.&nbsp; The scullery-maid said
that if everybody did their own work other people would not be 
driven beyond the limits of human endurance; and the housekeeper 
said that she was sick and tired of life.&nbsp; My friend said it
did not matter.&nbsp; The Child clung to the frying-pan with 
passion.&nbsp; The book my friend was reading said that was how 
the human mind was formed: the Child&rsquo;s instinct prompted it
to seize upon objects tending to develop its brain faculty.&nbsp;
What the parent had got to do was to stand aside and watch 
events.</p>
<p>The Child proceeded to black everything about the nursery with
the bottom of the frying-pan.&nbsp; It then set to work to lick 
the frying-pan clean.&nbsp; The nurse, a woman of narrow ideas, 
had a presentiment that later on it would be ill.&nbsp; My friend
explained to her the error the world had hitherto committed: it 
had imagined that the parent knew a thing or two that the Child 
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; In future the Children were to do their 
bringing up themselves.&nbsp; In the house of the future the 
parents would be allotted the attics where they would be out of 
the way.&nbsp; They might occasionally be allowed down to dinner,
say, on Sundays.</p>
<p>The Child, having exhausted all the nourishment the frying-pan
contained, sought to develop its brain faculty by thumping itself
over the head with the flat of the thing.&nbsp; With the 
selfishness of the average parent&mdash;thinking chiefly of what 
the Coroner might say, and indifferent to the future of humanity,
my friend insisted upon changing the game.</p>
<h3>His foolish talk.</h3>
<p>The parent does not even know how to talk to his own 
Child.&nbsp; The Child is yearning to acquire a correct and 
dignified mode of expression.&nbsp; The parent says: &ldquo;Did 
ums.&nbsp; Did naughty table hurt ickle tootsie pootsies?&nbsp; 
Baby say: &lsquo;&rsquo;Oo naughty table.&nbsp; Me no love 
&rsquo;oo.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Child despairs of ever learning English.&nbsp; What should
we think ourselves were we to join a French class, and were the 
Instructor to commence talking to us French of this 
description?&nbsp; What the Child, according to the gentleman 
from Cambridge, says to itself is,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh for one hour&rsquo;s intelligent conversation with a
human being who can talk the language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will not the young gentleman from Cambridge descend to 
detail?&nbsp; Will he not give us a specimen dialogue?</p>
<p>A celebrated lady writer, who has made herself the mouthpiece 
of feminine indignation against male stupidity, took up the 
cudgels a little while ago on behalf of Mrs. Caudle.&nbsp; She 
admitted Mrs. Caudle appeared to be a somewhat foolish 
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>But what had Caudle ever done to improve 
Mrs. Caudle&rsquo;s mind</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Had he ever sought, 
with intelligent illuminating conversation, to direct her 
thoughts towards other topics than lent umbrellas and red-headed 
minxes?</p>
<p>It is my complaint against so many of our teachers.&nbsp; They
scold us for what we do, but so rarely tell us what we ought to 
do.&nbsp; Tell me how to talk to my baby, and I am willing to 
try.&nbsp; It is not as if I took a personal pride in the phrase:
&ldquo;Did ums.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not even invent it.&nbsp; I 
found it, so to speak, when I got here, and my experience is that
it soothes the Child.&nbsp; When he is howling, and I say 
&ldquo;Did ums&rdquo; with sympathetic intonation, he stops 
crying.&nbsp; Possibly enough it is astonishment at the 
ineptitude of the remark that silences him.&nbsp; Maybe it is 
that minor troubles are lost sight of face to face with the 
reflection that this is the sort of father with which fate has 
provided him.&nbsp; But may not even this be useful to him?&nbsp;
He has got to meet with stupid people in the world.&nbsp; Let him
begin by contemplating me.&nbsp; It will make things easier for 
him later on.&nbsp; I put forward the idea in the hope of 
comforting the young gentleman from Cambridge.</p>
<p>We injure the health of the Child by enforcing on it 
silence.&nbsp; We have a stupid formula that children should be 
seen and not heard.&nbsp; We deny it exercise to its lungs.&nbsp;
We discourage its natural and laudable curiosity by telling it 
not to worry us&mdash;not to ask so many questions.</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t somebody lend the young gentleman from Cambridge a
small and healthy child just for a week or so, and let the 
bargain be that he lives with it all the time?&nbsp; The young 
gentleman from Cambridge thinks, when we call up the stairs to 
say that if we hear another sound from the nursery during the 
next two hours we will come up and do things to that Child the 
mere thought of which should appal it, that is silencing the 
Child.&nbsp; It does not occur to him that two minutes later that
Child is yelling again at the top of its voice, having forgotten 
all we ever said.</p>
<h3>The Child of Fiction.</h3>
<p>I know the sort of Child the weeper over Children&rsquo;s 
wrongs has in his mind.&nbsp; It has deep, soulful, yearning 
eyes.&nbsp; It moves about the house softly, shedding an 
atmosphere of patient resignation.&nbsp; It says: &ldquo;Yes, 
dear papa.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, dear mamma.&rdquo;&nbsp; It 
has but one ambition&mdash;to be good and useful.&nbsp; It has 
beautiful thoughts about the stars.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know 
whether it is in the house or isn&rsquo;t: you find it with its 
little face pressed close against the window-pane watching the 
golden sunset.&nbsp; Nobody understands it.&nbsp; It blesses the 
old people and dies.&nbsp; One of these days the young gentleman 
from Cambridge will, one hopes, have a Baby of his own&mdash;a 
real Child: and serve him darn-well right.</p>
<p>At present he is labouring under a wrong conception of the 
article.&nbsp; He says we over-educate it.&nbsp; We clog its 
wonderful brain with a mass of uninteresting facts and foolish 
formulas that we call knowledge.&nbsp; He does not know that all 
this time the Child is alive and kicking.&nbsp; He is under the 
delusion that the Child is taking all this lying down.&nbsp; We 
tell the Child it has got to be quiet, or else we will wring its 
neck.&nbsp; The gentleman from Cambridge pictures the Child as 
from that moment a silent spirit moving voiceless towards the 
grave.</p>
<p>We catch the Child in the morning, and clean it up, and put a 
little satchel on its back, and pack it off to school; and the 
maiden lady Understander pictures that Child wasting the all too 
brief period of youth crowding itself up with knowledge.</p>
<p>My dear Madam, you take it from me that your tears are being 
wasted.&nbsp; You wipe your eyes and cheer up.&nbsp; The dear 
Child is not going to be overworked: <i>he</i> is seeing to 
that.</p>
<p>As a matter of the fact, the Child of the present day is 
having, if anything, too good a time.&nbsp; I shall be considered
a brute for saying this, but I am thinking of its future, and my 
opinion is that we are giving it swelled head.&nbsp; The argument
just now in the air is that the parent exists merely for the 
Children.&nbsp; The parent doesn&rsquo;t count.&nbsp; It is as if
a gardener were to say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother the flowers, let them rot.&nbsp; The sooner they
are out of the way the better.&nbsp; The seed is the only thing 
that interests me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t produce respectable seed but from carefully 
cultivated flowers.&nbsp; The philosopher, clamouring for 
improved Children, will later grasp the fact that the parent is 
of importance.&nbsp; Then he will change his tactics, and address
the Children, and we shall have our time.&nbsp; He will impress 
on them how necessary it is for their own sakes that they should 
be careful of us.&nbsp; We shall have books written about 
misunderstood fathers who were worried into early graves.</p>
<h3>The misunderstood Father.</h3>
<p>Fresh Air Funds will be started for sending parents away to 
the seaside on visits to kind bachelors living in detached 
houses, miles away from Children.&nbsp; Books will be specially 
written for us picturing a world where school fees are never 
demanded and babies never howl o&rsquo; nights.&nbsp; Societies 
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Parents will arise.&nbsp; Little
girls who get their hair entangled and mislay all their clothes 
just before they are starting for the party&mdash;little boys who
kick holes in their best shoes will be spanked at the public 
expense.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>Marriage and the Joke of it.</h3>
<p>Marriages are made in heaven&mdash;&ldquo;but solely,&rdquo; 
it has been added by a cynical writer, &ldquo;for 
export.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is nothing more remarkable in human 
sociology than our attitude towards the institution of 
marriage.&nbsp; So it came home to me the other evening as I sat 
on a cane chair in the ill-lighted schoolroom of a small country 
town.&nbsp; The occasion was a Penny Reading.&nbsp; We had 
listened to the usual overture from <i>Zampa</i>, played by the 
lady professor and the eldest daughter of the brewer; to 
&ldquo;Phil Blood&rsquo;s Leap,&rdquo; recited by the curate; to 
the violin solo by the pretty widow about whom gossip is 
whispered&mdash;one hopes it is not true.&nbsp; Then a pale-faced
gentleman, with a drooping black moustache, walked on to the 
platform.&nbsp; It was the local tenor.&nbsp; He sang to us a 
song of love.&nbsp; Misunderstandings had arisen; bitter words, 
regretted as soon as uttered, had pierced the all too sensitive 
spirit.&nbsp; Parting had followed.&nbsp; The broken-hearted one 
had died believing his affection unrequited.&nbsp; But the angels
had since told him; he knew she loved him now&mdash;the accent on
the now.</p>
<p>I glanced around me.&nbsp; We were the usual crowd of mixed 
humanity&mdash;tinkers, tailors, soldiers, sailors, with our 
cousins, and our sisters, and our wives.&nbsp; So many of our 
eyes were wet with tears.&nbsp; Miss Butcher could hardly repress
her sobs.&nbsp; Young Mr. Tinker, his face hidden behind his 
programme, pretended to be blowing his nose.&nbsp; Mrs. 
Apothecary&rsquo;s large bosom heaved with heartfelt sighs.&nbsp;
The retired Colonel sniffed audibly.&nbsp; Sadness rested on our 
souls.&nbsp; It might have been so different but for those 
foolish, hasty words!&nbsp; There need have been no 
funeral.&nbsp; Instead, the church might have been decked with 
bridal flowers.&nbsp; How sweet she would have looked beneath her
orange wreath!&nbsp; How proudly, gladly, he might have responded
&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; take her for his wedded wife, to have and 
to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer 
for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, 
till death did them part.&nbsp; And thereto he might have 
plighted his troth.</p>
<p>In the silence which reigned after the applause had subsided 
the beautiful words of the Marriage Service seemed to be stealing
through the room: that they might ever remain in perfect love and
peace together.&nbsp; Thy wife shall be as the fruitful 
vine.&nbsp; Thy children like the olive branches round about thy 
table.&nbsp; Lo! thus shall a man be blessed.&nbsp; So shall men 
love their wives as their own bodies, and be not bitter against 
them, giving honour unto them as unto the weaker vessel.&nbsp; 
Let the wife see that she reverence her husband, wearing the 
ornament of a meek and quiet spirit.</p>
<h3>Love and the Satyr.</h3>
<p>All the stories sung by the sweet singers of all time were 
echoing in our ears&mdash;stories of true love that would not run
smoothly until the last chapter; of gallant lovers strong and 
brave against fate; of tender sweethearts, waiting, trusting, 
till love&rsquo;s golden crown was won; so they married and lived
happy ever after.</p>
<p>Then stepped briskly on the platform a stout, bald-headed 
man.&nbsp; We greeted him with enthusiasm&mdash;it was the local 
low comedian.&nbsp; The piano tinkled saucily.&nbsp; The 
self-confident man winked and opened wide his mouth.&nbsp; It was
a funny song; how we roared with laughter!&nbsp; The last line of
each verse was the same:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before it was &lsquo;duckie,&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;darling,&rsquo; and &lsquo;dear.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now 
it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Take your cold feet away, Brute! can&rsquo;t 
you hear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once they walked hand in hand: &lsquo;Me loves ickle 
&rsquo;oo.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now he strides on ahead&rdquo; (imitation
with aid of umbrella much appreciated; the bald-headed man, in 
his enthusiasm and owing to the smallness of the platform, 
sweeping the lady accompanist off her stool), &ldquo;bawling: 
&lsquo;Come along, do.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bald-headed man interspersed side-splitting patter.&nbsp; 
The husband comes home late; the wife is waiting for him at the 
top of the stairs with a broom.&nbsp; He kisses the 
servant-girl.&nbsp; She retaliates by discovering a cousin in the
Guards.</p>
<p>The comic man retired to an enthusiastic demand for an 
encore.&nbsp; I looked around me at the laughing faces.&nbsp; 
Miss Butcher had been compelled to stuff her handkerchief into 
her mouth.&nbsp; Mr. Tinker was wiping his eyes; he was not 
ashamed this time, they were tears of merriment.&nbsp; Mrs. 
Apothecary&rsquo;s motherly bosom was shaking like a jelly.&nbsp;
The Colonel was grinning from ear to ear.</p>
<p>Later on, as I noticed in the programme, the schoolmistress, 
an unmarried lady, was down to sing &ldquo;Darby and 
Joan.&rdquo;&nbsp; She has a sympathetic voice.&nbsp; Her 
&ldquo;Darby and Joan&rdquo; is always popular.&nbsp; The comic 
man would also again appear in the second part, and would oblige 
with (by request) &ldquo;His Mother-in-Law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the quaint comedy continues: To-night we will enjoy 
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, for to-morrow we have seats booked for 
<i>The Pink Domino</i>.</p>
<h3>What the Gipsy did not mention.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the pretty lady let the poor old gipsy tell
her fortune?&rdquo;&nbsp; Blushes, giggles, protestations.&nbsp; 
Gallant gentleman friend insists.&nbsp; A dark man is in love 
with pretty lady.&nbsp; Gipsy sees a marriage not so very far 
ahead.&nbsp; Pretty lady says &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; but 
looks serious.&nbsp; Pretty lady&rsquo;s pretty friends must, of 
course, be teasing.&nbsp; Gallant gentleman friend, by curious 
coincidence, happens to be dark.&nbsp; Gipsy grins and passes 
on.</p>
<p>Is that all the gipsy knows of pretty lady&rsquo;s 
future?&nbsp; The rheumy, cunning eyes!&nbsp; They were bonny and
black many years ago, when the parchment skin was smooth and 
fair.&nbsp; They have seen so many a passing show&mdash;do they 
see in pretty lady&rsquo;s hand nothing further?</p>
<p>What would the wicked old eyes foresee did it pay them to 
speak:&mdash;Pretty lady crying tears into a pillow.&nbsp; Pretty
lady growing ugly, spite and anger spoiling pretty 
features.&nbsp; Dark young man no longer loving.&nbsp; Dark young
man hurling bitter words at pretty lady&mdash;hurling, maybe, 
things more heavy.&nbsp; Dark young man and pretty lady listening
approvingly to comic singer, having both discovered: 
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like when you&rsquo;re 
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend H. G. Wells wrote a book, &ldquo;The Island of Dr. 
Moreau.&rdquo;&nbsp; I read it in MS. one winter evening in a 
lonely country house upon the hills, wind screaming to wind in 
the dark without.&nbsp; The story has haunted me ever 
since.&nbsp; I hear the wind&rsquo;s shrill laughter.&nbsp; The 
doctor had taken the beasts of the forest, apes, tigers, strange 
creatures from the deep, had fashioned them with hideous cruelty 
into the shapes of men, had given them souls, had taught to them 
the law.&nbsp; In all things else were they human, but their 
original instincts their creator&rsquo;s skill had failed to 
eliminate.&nbsp; All their lives were one long torture.&nbsp; The
Law said, &ldquo;We are men and women; this we shall do, this we 
shall not do.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the ape and tiger still cried 
aloud within them.</p>
<p>Civilization lays her laws upon us; they are the laws of 
gods&mdash;of the men that one day, perhaps, shall come.&nbsp; 
But the primeval creature of the cave still cries within us.</p>
<h3>A few rules for Married Happiness.</h3>
<p>The wonder is that not being gods&mdash;being mere men and 
women&mdash;marriage works out as well as it does.&nbsp; We take 
two creatures with the instincts of the ape still stirring within
them; two creatures fashioned on the law of selfishness; two 
self-centred creatures of opposite appetites, of desires opposed 
to one another, of differing moods and fancies; two creatures not
yet taught the lesson of self-control, of self-renunciation, and 
bind them together for life in an union so close that one cannot 
snore o&rsquo;nights without disturbing the other&rsquo;s rest; 
that one cannot, without risk to happiness, have a single taste 
unshared by the other; that neither, without danger of upsetting 
the whole applecart, so to speak, can have an opinion with which 
the other does not heartedly agree.</p>
<p>Could two angels exist together on such terms without ever 
quarrelling?&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; To make marriage the ideal 
we love to picture it in romance, the elimination of human nature
is the first essential.&nbsp; Supreme unselfishness, perfect 
patience, changeless amiability, we should have to start with, 
and continue with, until the end.</p>
<h3>The real Darby and Joan.</h3>
<p>I do not believe in the &ldquo;Darby and Joan&rdquo; of the 
song.&nbsp; They belong to song-land.&nbsp; To accept them I need
a piano, a sympathetic contralto voice, a firelight effect, and 
that sentimental mood in myself, the foundation of which is a 
good dinner well digested.&nbsp; But there are Darbys and Joans 
of real flesh and blood to be met with&mdash;God bless them, and 
send more for our example&mdash;wholesome living men and women, 
brave, struggling, souls with common-sense.&nbsp; Ah, yes! they 
have quarrelled; had their dark house of bitterness, of hate, 
when he wished to heaven he had never met her, and told her 
so.&nbsp; How could he have guessed those sweet lips could utter 
such cruel words; those tender eyes, he loved to kiss, flash with
scorn and anger?</p>
<p>And she, had she known what lay behind; those days when he 
knelt before her, swore that his only dream was to save her from 
all pain.&nbsp; Passion lies dead; it is a flame that burns out 
quickly.&nbsp; The most beautiful face in the world grows 
indifferent to us when we have sat opposite it every morning at 
breakfast, every evening at supper, for a brief year or 
two.&nbsp; Passion is the seed.&nbsp; Love grows from it, a 
tender sapling, beautiful to look upon, but wondrous frail, 
easily broken, easily trampled on during those first years of 
wedded life.&nbsp; Only by much nursing, by long caring-for, 
watered with tears, shall it grow into a sturdy tree, defiant of 
the winds, &rsquo;neath which Darby and Joan shall sit sheltered 
in old age.</p>
<p>They had commonsense, brave hearts.&nbsp; Darby had expected 
too much.&nbsp; Darby had not made allowance for human nature 
which he ought to have done, seeing how much he had of it 
himself.&nbsp; Joan knows he did not mean it.&nbsp; Joan has a 
nasty temper; she admits it.&nbsp; Joan will try, Darby will 
try.&nbsp; They kiss again with tears.&nbsp; It is a workaday 
world; Darby and Joan will take it as it is, will do their 
best.&nbsp; A little kindness, a little clasping of the hands 
before night comes.</p>
<h3>Many ways of Love.</h3>
<p>Youth deems it heresy, but I sometimes wonder if our English 
speaking way is quite the best.&nbsp; I discussed the subject 
once with an old French lady.&nbsp; The English reader forms his 
idea of French life from the French novel; it leads to mistaken 
notions.&nbsp; There are French Darbys, French Joans, many 
thousands of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; said my old French friend, 
&ldquo;your English way is wrong; our way is not perfect, but it 
is the better, I am sure.&nbsp; You leave it entirely to the 
young people.&nbsp; What do they know of life, of themselves, 
even.&nbsp; He falls in love with a pretty face.&nbsp; 
She&mdash;he danced so well! he was so agreeable that day of the 
picnic!&nbsp; If marriage were only for a month or so; could be 
ended without harm when the passion was burnt out.&nbsp; Ah, yes!
then perhaps you would be right.&nbsp; I loved at eighteen, 
madly&mdash;nearly broke my heart.&nbsp; I meet him occasionally 
now.&nbsp; My dear&rdquo;&mdash;her hair was silvery white, and I
was only thirty-five; she always called me &ldquo;my dear&rdquo;;
it is pleasant at thirty-five to be talked to as a child.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;He was a perfect brute, handsome he had been, yes, but all
that was changed.&nbsp; He was as stupid as an ox.&nbsp; I never 
see his poor frightened-looking wife without shuddering thinking 
of what I have escaped.&nbsp; They told me all that, but I looked
only at his face, and did not believe them.&nbsp; They forced me 
into marriage with the kindest man that ever lived.&nbsp; I did 
not love him then, but I loved him for thirty years; was it not 
better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear friend,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;that 
poor, frightened-looking wife of your first love!&nbsp; Her 
marriage also was, I take it, the result of parental 
choosing.&nbsp; The love marriage, I admit, as often as not turns
out sadly.&nbsp; The children choose ill.&nbsp; Parents also 
choose ill.&nbsp; I fear there is no sure receipt for the happy 
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are arguing from bad examples,&rdquo; answered my 
silver-haired friend; &ldquo;it is the system that I am 
defending.&nbsp; A young girl is no judge of character.&nbsp; She
is easily deceived, is wishful to be deceived.&nbsp; As I have 
said, she does not even know herself.&nbsp; She imagines the mood
of the moment will remain with her.&nbsp; Only those who have 
watched over her with loving insight from her infancy know her 
real temperament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young man is blinded by his passion.&nbsp; Nature 
knows nothing of marriage, of companionship.&nbsp; She has only 
one aim.&nbsp; That accomplished, she is indifferent to the 
future of those she has joined together.&nbsp; I would have 
parents think only of their children&rsquo;s happiness, giving to
worldly considerations their true value, but nothing beyond, 
choosing for their children with loving care, with sense of their
great responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Which is it?</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I fear our young people would not be contented with our
choosing,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they so contented with their own, the honeymoon 
over?&rdquo; she responded with a smile.</p>
<p>We agreed it was a difficult problem viewed from any 
point.</p>
<p>But I still think it would be better were we to heap less 
ridicule upon the institution.&nbsp; Matrimony cannot be 
&ldquo;holy&rdquo; and ridiculous at the same time.&nbsp; We have
been familiar with it long enough to make up our minds in which 
light to regard it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>Man and his Tailor.</h3>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with the &ldquo;Made-up Tie&rdquo;?&nbsp; I
gather from the fashionable novelist that no man can wear a 
made-up tie and be a gentleman.&nbsp; He may be a worthy man, 
clever, well-to-do, eligible from every other point of view; but 
She, the refined heroine, can never get over the fact that he 
wears a made-up tie.&nbsp; It causes a shudder down her high-bred
spine whenever she thinks of it.&nbsp; There is nothing else to 
be said against him.&nbsp; There is nothing worse about him than 
this&mdash;he wears a made-up tie.&nbsp; It is all 
sufficient.&nbsp; No true woman could ever care for him, no 
really classy society ever open its doors to him.</p>
<p>I am worried about this thing because, to confess the horrid 
truth, I wear a made-up tie myself.&nbsp; On foggy afternoons I 
steal out of the house disguised.&nbsp; They ask me where I am 
going in a hat that comes down over my ears, and why I am wearing
blue spectacles and a false beard, but I will not tell 
them.&nbsp; I creep along the wall till I find a common 
hosier&rsquo;s shop, and then, in an assumed voice, I tell the 
man what it is I want.&nbsp; They come to fourpence halfpenny 
each; by taking the half-dozen I get them for a trifle 
less.&nbsp; They are put on in a moment, and, to my vulgar eye, 
look neat and tasteful.</p>
<p>Of course, I know I am not a gentleman.&nbsp; I have given up 
hopes of ever being one.&nbsp; Years ago, when life presented 
possibilities, I thought that with pains and intelligence I might
become one.&nbsp; I never succeeded.&nbsp; It all depends on 
being able to tie a bow.&nbsp; Round the bed-post, or the neck of
the water-jug, I could tie the wretched thing to 
perfection.&nbsp; If only the bed-post or the water-jug could 
have taken my place and gone to the party instead of me, life 
would have been simpler.&nbsp; The bed-post and the water-jug, in
its neat white bow, looked like a gentleman&mdash;the fashionable
novelist&rsquo;s idea of a gentleman.&nbsp; Upon myself the 
result was otherwise, suggesting always a feeble attempt at 
suicide by strangulation.&nbsp; I could never understand how it 
was done.&nbsp; There were moments when it flashed across me that
the secret lay in being able to turn one&rsquo;s self inside out,
coming up with one&rsquo;s arms and legs the other way 
round.&nbsp; Standing on one&rsquo;s head might have surmounted 
the difficulty; but the higher gymnastics Nature has denied to 
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Boneless Wonder&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Man 
Serpent&rdquo; could, I felt, be a gentleman so easily.&nbsp; To 
one to whom has been given only the common ordinary joints 
gentlemanliness is apparently an impossible ideal.</p>
<p>It is not only the tie.&nbsp; I never read the fashionable 
novel without misgiving.&nbsp; Some hopeless bounder is being 
described:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to know what he is like,&rdquo; says the 
Peer of the Realm, throwing himself back in his deep easy-chair, 
and puffing lazily at his cigar of delicate aroma, &ldquo;he is 
the sort of man that wears three studs in his shirt.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The difficulty of being a Gentleman.</h3>
<p>Merciful heavens!&nbsp; I myself wear three studs in my 
shirt.&nbsp; I also am a hopeless bounder, and I never knew 
it.&nbsp; It comes upon me like a thunderbolt.&nbsp; I thought 
three studs were fashionable.&nbsp; The idiot at the shop told me
three studs were all the rage, and I ordered two dozen.&nbsp; I 
can&rsquo;t afford to throw them away.&nbsp; Till these two dozen
shirts are worn out, I shall have to remain a hopeless 
bounder.</p>
<p>Why have we not a Minister of the Fine Arts?&nbsp; Why does 
not a paternal Government fix notices at the street corners, 
telling the would-be gentleman how many studs he ought to wear, 
what style of necktie now distinguishes the noble-minded man from
the base-hearted?&nbsp; They are prompt enough with their police 
regulations, their vaccination orders&mdash;the higher things of 
life they neglect.</p>
<p>I select at random another masterpiece of English 
literature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; says Lady Montresor, with her light 
aristocratic laugh, &ldquo;you surely cannot seriously think of 
marrying a man who wears socks with yellow spots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Emmelina sighs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is very nice,&rdquo; she murmurs, &ldquo;but I 
suppose you are right.&nbsp; I suppose that sort of man does get 
on your nerves after a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; says Lady Montresor, &ldquo;he is
impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a cold sweat I rush upstairs into my bedroom.</p>
<p>I thought so: I am always wrong.&nbsp; All my best socks have 
yellow spots.&nbsp; I rather fancied them.&nbsp; They were 
expensive, too, now I come to think of it.</p>
<p>What am I to do?&nbsp; If I sacrifice them and get red spots, 
then red spots, for all I know, may be wrong.&nbsp; I have no 
instinct.&nbsp; The fashionable novelist never helps one.&nbsp; 
He tells us what is wrong, but he does not tell us what is 
right.&nbsp; It is creative criticism that I feel the need 
of.&nbsp; Why does not the Lady Montresor go on?&nbsp; Tell me 
what sort of socks the ideal lover ought to wear.&nbsp; There are
so many varieties of socks.&nbsp; What is a would-be-gentleman to
do?&nbsp; Would it be of any use writing to the fashionable 
novelist:&mdash;</p>
<h3>How we might, all of us, be Gentlemen.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Fashionable Novelist (or should it be 
Miss?),&mdash;Before going to my tailor, I venture to write to 
you on a subject of some importance.&nbsp; I am fairly well 
educated, of good family and address, and, so my friends tell me,
of passable appearance.&nbsp; I yearn to become a 
gentleman.&nbsp; If it is not troubling you too much, would you 
mind telling me how to set about the business?&nbsp; What socks 
and ties ought I to wear?&nbsp; Do I wear a flower in my 
button-hole, or is that a sign of a coarse mind?&nbsp; How many 
buttons on a morning coat show a beautiful nature?&nbsp; Does a 
stand-up collar with a tennis shirt prove that you are of noble 
descent, or, on the contrary, stamp you as a 
<i>parvenu</i>?&nbsp; If answering these questions imposes too 
great a tax on your time, perhaps you would not mind telling me 
how you yourself know these things.&nbsp; Who is your authority, 
and when is he at home?&nbsp; I should apologize for writing to 
you but that I feel you will sympathize with my appeal.&nbsp; It 
seems a pity there should be so many vulgar, ill-bred people in 
the world when a little knowledge on these trivial points would 
enable us all to become gentlemen.&nbsp; Thanking you in 
anticipation, I remain . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>Would he or she tell us?&nbsp; Or would the fashionable 
novelist reply as I once overheard a harassed mother retort upon 
one of her inquiring children.&nbsp; Most of the afternoon she 
had been rushing out into the garden, where games were in 
progress, to tell the children what they must not 
do:&mdash;&ldquo;Tommy, you know you must not do that.&nbsp; 
Haven&rsquo;t you got any sense at all?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Johnny, you wicked boy, how dare you do that; how many 
more times do you want me to tell you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Jane, 
if you do that again you will go straight to bed, my girl!&rdquo;
and so on.</p>
<p>At length the door was opened from without, and a little face 
peeped in: &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what is it? can&rsquo;t I ever get a 
moment&rsquo;s peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, please would you mind telling us something we 
might do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady almost fell back on the floor in her 
astonishment.&nbsp; The idea had never occurred to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What may you do!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ask me.&nbsp; I am 
tired enough of telling you what not to do.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Things a Gentleman should never do.</h3>
<p>I remember when a young man, wishful to conform to the rules 
of good society, I bought a book of etiquette for 
gentlemen.&nbsp; Its fault was just this.&nbsp; It told me 
through many pages what not to do.&nbsp; Beyond that it seemed to
have no idea.&nbsp; I made a list of things it said a gentleman 
should <i>never</i> do: it was a lengthy list.</p>
<p>Determined to do the job completely while I was about it, I 
bought other books of etiquette and added on their list of 
&ldquo;Nevers.&rdquo;&nbsp; What one book left out another 
supplied.&nbsp; There did not seem much left for a gentleman to 
do.</p>
<p>I concluded by the time I had come to the end of my books, 
that to be a true gentleman my safest course would be to stop in 
bed for the rest of my life.&nbsp; By this means only could I 
hope to avoid every possible <i>faux pas</i>, every 
solecism.&nbsp; I should have lived and died a gentleman.&nbsp; I
could have had it engraved upon my tombstone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never in his life committed a single act unbecoming 
to a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be a gentleman is not so easy, perhaps, as a fashionable 
novelist imagines.&nbsp; One is forced to the conclusion that it 
is not a question entirely for the outfitter.&nbsp; My attention 
was attracted once by a notice in the window of a West-End 
emporium, &ldquo;Gentlemen supplied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is to such like Universal Providers that the fashionable 
novelist goes for his gentleman.&nbsp; The gentleman is supplied 
to him complete in every detail.&nbsp; If the reader be not 
satisfied, that is the reader&rsquo;s fault.&nbsp; He is one of 
those tiresome, discontented customers who does not know a good 
article when he has got it.</p>
<p>I was told the other day of the writer of a musical farce (or 
is it comedy?) who was most desirous that his leading character 
should be a perfect gentleman.&nbsp; During the dress rehearsal, 
the actor representing the part had to open his cigarette case 
and request another perfect gentleman to help himself.&nbsp; The 
actor drew forth his case.&nbsp; It caught the critical eye of 
the author.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what do you call 
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cigarette case,&rdquo; answered the actor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear boy,&rdquo; exclaimed the author, 
&ldquo;surely it is silver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; admitted the actor, &ldquo;it does 
perhaps suggest that I am living beyond my means, but the truth 
is I picked it up cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author turned to the manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;a real
gentleman always carries a gold cigarette case.&nbsp; He must be 
a gentleman, or there&rsquo;s no point in the plot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us endanger any point the plot may 
happen to possess, for goodness sake,&rdquo; agreed the manager, 
&ldquo;let him by all means have a gold cigarette 
case.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>How one may know the perfect Gentleman.</h3>
<p>So, regardless of expense, a gold cigarette case was obtained 
and put down to expenses.&nbsp; And yet on the first night of 
that musical play, when that leading personage smashed a tray 
over a waiter&rsquo;s head, and, after a row with the police, 
came home drunk to his wife, even that gold cigarette case failed
to convince one that the man was a gentleman beyond all 
doubt.</p>
<p>The old writers appear to have been singularly unaware of the 
importance attaching to these socks, and ties, and 
cigarette-cases.&nbsp; They told us merely what the man felt and 
thought.&nbsp; What reliance can we place upon them?&nbsp; How 
could they possibly have known what sort of man he was underneath
his clothes?&nbsp; Tweed or broadcloth is not transparent.&nbsp; 
Even could they have got rid of his clothes there would have 
remained his flesh and bones.&nbsp; It was pure guess-work.&nbsp;
They did not observe.</p>
<p>The modern writer goes to work scientifically.&nbsp; He tells 
us that the creature wore a made-up tie.&nbsp; From that we know 
he was not a gentleman; it follows as the night the day.&nbsp; 
The fashionable novelist notices the young man&rsquo;s 
socks.&nbsp; It reveals to us whether the marriage would have 
been successful or a failure.&nbsp; It is necessary to convince 
us that the hero is a perfect gentleman: the author gives him a 
gold cigarette case.</p>
<p>A well-known dramatist has left it on record that comedy 
cannot exist nowadays, for the simple reason that gentlemen have 
given up taking snuff and wearing swords.&nbsp; How can one have 
comedy in company with frock-coats&mdash;without its 
&ldquo;Las&rdquo; and its &ldquo;Odds Bobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sword may have been helpful.&nbsp; I have been told that 
at <i>lev&eacute;es</i> City men, unaccustomed to the thing, 
have, with its help, provided comedy for the rest of the 
company.</p>
<p>But I take it this is not the comedy our dramatist had in 
mind.</p>
<h3>Why not an Exhibition of Gentlemen?</h3>
<p>It seems a pity that comedy should disappear from among 
us.&nbsp; If it depend entirely on swords and snuff-boxes, would 
it not be worth the while of the Society of Authors to keep a few
gentlemen specially trained?&nbsp; Maybe some sympathetic 
theatrical manager would lend us costumes of the eighteenth 
century.&nbsp; We might provide them with swords and 
snuff-boxes.&nbsp; They might meet, say, once a week, in a Queen 
Anne drawing-room, especially prepared by Gillow, and go through 
their tricks.&nbsp; Authors seeking high-class comedy might be 
admitted to a gallery.</p>
<p>Perhaps this explains why old-fashioned readers complain that 
we do not give them human nature.&nbsp; How can we?&nbsp; Ladies 
and gentlemen nowadays don&rsquo;t wear the proper clothes.&nbsp;
Evidently it all depends upon the clothes.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>Woman and her behaviour.</h3>
<p>Should women smoke?</p>
<p>The question, in four-inch letters, exhibited on a placard 
outside a small newsvendor&rsquo;s shop, caught recently my 
eye.&nbsp; The wanderer through London streets is familiar with 
such-like appeals to his decision: &ldquo;Should short men marry 
tall wives?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ought we to cut our 
hair?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Should second cousins 
kiss?&rdquo;&nbsp; Life&rsquo;s problems appear to be 
endless.</p>
<p>Personally, I am not worrying myself whether women should 
smoke or not.&nbsp; It seems to me a question for the individual 
woman to decide for herself.&nbsp; I like women who smoke; I can 
see no objection to their smoking.&nbsp; Smoking soothes the 
nerves.&nbsp; Women&rsquo;s nerves occasionally want 
soothing.&nbsp; The tiresome idiot who argues that smoking is 
unwomanly denounces the drinking of tea as unmanly.&nbsp; He is a
wooden-headed person who derives all his ideas from cheap 
fiction.&nbsp; The manly man of cheap fiction smokes a pipe and 
drinks whisky.&nbsp; That is how we know he is a man.&nbsp; The 
womanly woman&mdash;well, I always feel I could make a better 
woman myself out of an old clothes shop and a 
hair-dresser&rsquo;s block.</p>
<p>But, as I have said, the question does not impress me as one 
demanding my particular attention.&nbsp; I also like the woman 
who does not smoke.&nbsp; I have met in my time some very 
charming women who do not smoke.&nbsp; It may be a sign of 
degeneracy, but I am prepared to abdicate my position of 
woman&rsquo;s god, leaving her free to lead her own life.</p>
<h3>Woman&rsquo;s God.</h3>
<p>Candidly, the responsibility of feeling myself answerable for 
all a woman does or does not do would weigh upon me.&nbsp; There 
are men who are willing to take this burden upon themselves, and 
a large number of women are still anxious that they should 
continue to bear it.&nbsp; I spoke quite seriously to a young 
lady not long ago on the subject of tight lacing; undoubtedly she
was injuring her health.&nbsp; She admitted it herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all you can say,&rdquo; she wailed; &ldquo;I 
daresay a lot of it is true.&nbsp; Those awful pictures where one
sees&mdash;well, all the things one does not want to think 
about.&nbsp; If they are correct, it must be bad, squeezing it 
all up together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why continue to do so?&rdquo; I argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy enough to talk,&rdquo; she 
explained; &ldquo;a few old fogies like you&rdquo;&mdash;I had 
been speaking very plainly to her, and she was cross with 
me&mdash;&ldquo;may pretend you don&rsquo;t like small waists, 
but <i>the average man does</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor girl!&nbsp; She was quite prepared to injure herself for 
life, to damage her children&rsquo;s future, to be uncomfortable 
for fifteen hours a day, all to oblige the average man.</p>
<p>It is a compliment to our sex.&nbsp; What man would suffer 
injury and torture to please the average woman?&nbsp; This 
frenzied desire of woman to conform to our ideals is 
touching.&nbsp; A few daring spirits of late years have exhibited
a tendency to seek for other gods&mdash;for ideals of their 
own.&nbsp; We call them the unsexed women.&nbsp; The womanly 
women lift up their hands in horror of such blasphemy.</p>
<p>When I was a boy no womanly woman rode a 
bicycle&mdash;tricycles were permitted.&nbsp; On three wheels you
could still be womanly, but on two you were &ldquo;a 
creature&rdquo;!&nbsp; The womanly woman, seeing her approach, 
would draw down the parlour blind with a jerk, lest the children 
looking out might catch a glimpse of her, and their young souls 
be smirched for all eternity.</p>
<p>No womanly woman rode inside a hansom or outside a 
&rsquo;bus.&nbsp; I remember the day my own dear mother climbed 
outside a &rsquo;bus for the first time in her life.&nbsp; She 
was excited, and cried a little; but nobody&mdash;heaven be 
praised!&mdash;saw us&mdash;that is, nobody of importance.&nbsp; 
And afterwards she confessed the air was pleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be not the first by whom the new is tried, Nor yet the 
last to lay the old aside,&rdquo; is a safe rule for those who 
would always retain the good opinion of that all-powerful, but 
somewhat unintelligent, incubus, &ldquo;the average 
person,&rdquo; but the pioneer, the guide, is necessary.&nbsp; 
That is, if the world is to move forward.</p>
<p>The freedom-loving girl of to-day, who can enjoy a walk by 
herself without losing her reputation, who can ride down the 
street on her &ldquo;bike&rdquo; without being hooted at, who can
play a mixed double at tennis without being compelled by public 
opinion to marry her partner, who can, in short, lead a human 
creature&rsquo;s life, and not that of a lap-dog led about at the
end of a string, might pause to think what she owes to the 
&ldquo;unsexed creatures&rdquo; who fought her battle for her 
fifty years ago.</p>
<h3>Those unsexed Creatures.</h3>
<p>Can the working woman of to-day, who may earn her own living, 
if she will, without loss of the elementary rights of womanhood, 
think of the bachelor girl of a short generation ago without 
admiration of her pluck?&nbsp; There were ladies in those day too
&ldquo;unwomanly&rdquo; to remain helpless burdens on overworked 
fathers and mothers, too &ldquo;unsexed&rdquo; to marry the first
man that came along for the sake of their bread and butter.&nbsp;
They fought their way into journalism, into the office, into the 
shop.&nbsp; The reformer is not always the pleasantest man to 
invite to a tea-party.&nbsp; Maybe these women who went forward 
with the flag were not the most charming of their sex.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;Dora Copperfield&rdquo; type will for some time remain the
young man&rsquo;s ideal, the model the young girl puts before 
herself.&nbsp; Myself, I think Dora Copperfield charming, but a 
world of Dora Copperfields!</p>
<p>The working woman is a new development in sociology.&nbsp; She
has many lessons to learn, but one has hopes of her.&nbsp; It is 
said that she is unfitting herself to be a wife and mother.&nbsp;
If the ideal helpmeet for a man be an animated Dresden china 
shepherdess&mdash;something that looks pretty on the table, 
something to be shown round to one&rsquo;s friends, something 
that can be locked up safely in a cupboard, that asks no 
questions, and, therefore, need be told no lies&mdash;then a 
woman who has learnt something of the world, who has formed ideas
of her own, will not be the ideal wife.</p>
<h3>References given&mdash;and required.</h3>
<p>Maybe the average man will not be her ideal husband.&nbsp; 
Each Michaelmas at a little town in the Thames Valley with which 
I am acquainted there is held a hiring fair.&nbsp; A farmer one 
year laid his hand on a lively-looking lad, and asked him if he 
wanted a job.&nbsp; It was what the boy was looking for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a character?&rdquo; asked the farmer.&nbsp; The boy
replied that he had for the last two years been working for Mr. 
Muggs, the ironmonger&mdash;felt sure that Mr. Muggs would give 
him a good character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go and ask Mr. Muggs to come across and speak to 
me, I will wait here,&rdquo; directed the would-be 
employer.&nbsp; Five minutes went by&mdash;ten minutes.&nbsp; No 
Mr. Muggs appeared.&nbsp; Later in the afternoon the farmer met 
the boy again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Muggs never came near me with that character of 
yours,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered the boy, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
ask him to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; inquired the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I told him who it was that wanted 
it&rdquo;&mdash;the boy hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded the farmer, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, he told me yours,&rdquo; explained the 
boy.</p>
<p>Maybe the working woman, looking for a husband, and not merely
a livelihood, may end by formulating standards of her own.&nbsp; 
She may end by demanding the manly man and moving about the 
world, knowing something of life, may arrive at the conclusion 
that something more is needed than the smoking of pipes and the 
drinking of whiskies and sodas.&nbsp; We must be prepared for 
this.&nbsp; The sheltered woman who learnt her life from fairy 
stories is a dream of the past.&nbsp; Woman has escaped from her 
&ldquo;shelter&rdquo;&mdash;she is on the loose.&nbsp; For the 
future we men have got to accept the emancipated woman as an 
accomplished fact.</p>
<h3>The ideal World.</h3>
<p>Many of us are worried about her.&nbsp; What is going to 
become of the home?&nbsp; I admit there is a more ideal existence
where the working woman would find no place; it is in a world 
that exists only on the comic opera stage.&nbsp; There every 
picturesque village contains an equal number of ladies and 
gentlemen nearly all the same height and weight, to all 
appearance of the same age.&nbsp; Each Jack has his Jill, and 
does not want anybody else&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There are no 
complications: one presumes they draw lots and fall in love the 
moment they unscrew the paper.&nbsp; They dance for awhile on 
grass which is never damp, and then into the conveniently 
situated ivy-covered church they troop in pairs and are wedded 
off hand by a white-haired clergyman, who is a married man 
himself.</p>
<p>Ah, if the world were but a comic opera stage, there would be 
no need for working women!&nbsp; As a matter of fact, so far as 
one can judge from the front of the house, there are no working 
men either.</p>
<p>But outside the opera house in the muddy street Jack goes home
to his third floor back, or his chambers in the Albany, according
to his caste, and wonders when the time will come when he will be
able to support a wife.&nbsp; And Jill climbs on a penny 
&rsquo;bus, or steps into the family brougham, and dreams with 
regret of a lost garden, where there was just one man and just 
one woman, and clothes grew on a fig tree.</p>
<p>With the progress of civilization&mdash;utterly opposed as it 
is to all Nature&rsquo;s intentions&mdash;the number of working 
women will increase.&nbsp; With some friends the other day I was 
discussing motor-cars, and one gentleman with sorrow in his 
voice&mdash;he is the type of Conservative who would have 
regretted the passing away of the glacial period&mdash;opined 
that motor-cars had come to stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;they have come to
go.&rdquo;&nbsp; The working woman, however much we may regret 
it, has come to go, and she is going it.&nbsp; We shall have to 
accept her and see what can be done with her.&nbsp; One thing is 
certain, we shall not solve the problem of the twentieth century 
by regretting the simple sociology of the Stone Age.</p>
<h3>A Lover&rsquo;s View.</h3>
<p>Speaking as a lover, I welcome the openings that are being 
given to women to earn their own livelihood.&nbsp; I can conceive
of no more degrading profession for a woman&mdash;no profession 
more calculated to unfit her for being that wife and mother we 
talk so much about than the profession that up to a few years ago
was the only one open to her&mdash;the profession of 
husband-hunting.</p>
<p>As a man, I object to being regarded as woman&rsquo;s last 
refuge, her one and only alternative to the workhouse.&nbsp; I 
cannot myself see why the woman who has faced the difficulties of
existence, learnt the lesson of life, should not make as good a 
wife and mother as the ignorant girl taken direct, one might 
almost say, from the nursery, and, without the slightest 
preparation, put in a position of responsibility that to a 
thinking person must be almost appalling.</p>
<p>It has been said that the difference between men and women is 
this: That the man goes about the world making it ready for the 
children, that the woman stops at home making the children ready 
for the world.&nbsp; Will not she do it much better for knowing 
something of the world, for knowing something of the temptations,
the difficulties, her own children will have to face, for having 
learnt by her own experience to sympathize with the struggles, 
the sordid heart-breaking cares that man has daily to contend 
with?</p>
<p>Civilization is ever undergoing transformation, but human 
nature remains.&nbsp; The bachelor girl, in her bed-sitting room,
in her studio, in her flat, will still see in the shadows the 
vision of the home, will still hear in the silence the sound of 
children&rsquo;s voices, will still dream of the lover&rsquo;s 
kiss that is to open up new life to her.&nbsp; She is not quite 
so unsexed as you may think, my dear womanly madame.&nbsp; A male
friend of mine was telling me of a catastrophe that once occurred
at a station in the East Indies.</p>
<h3>No time to think of Husbands.</h3>
<p>A fire broke out at night, and everybody was in terror lest it
should reach the magazine.&nbsp; The women and children were 
being hurried to the ships, and two ladies were hastening past my
friend.&nbsp; One of them paused, and, clasping her hands, 
demanded of him if he knew what had become of her husband.&nbsp; 
Her companion was indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, don&rsquo;t dawdle, 
Maria,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;this is no time to think of 
husbands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no reason to fear that the working woman will ever 
cease to think of husbands.&nbsp; Maybe, as I have said, she will
demand a better article than the mere husband-hunter has been 
able to stand out for.&nbsp; Maybe she herself will have 
something more to give; maybe she will bring to him broader 
sympathies, higher ideals.&nbsp; The woman who has herself been 
down among the people, who has faced life in the open, will know 
that the home is but one cell of the vast hive.</p>
<p>We shall, perhaps, hear less of the woman who &ldquo;has her 
own home and children to think of&mdash;really takes no interest 
in these matters&rdquo;&mdash;these matters of right and wrong, 
these matters that spell the happiness or misery of millions.</p>
<h3>The Wife of the Future.</h3>
<p>Maybe the bridegroom of the future will not say, &ldquo;I have
married a wife, and therefore I cannot come,&rdquo; but &ldquo;I 
have married a wife; we will both come.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
